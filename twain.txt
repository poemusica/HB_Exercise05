He attracted me by three things:</div><div class='line' id='LC90'>his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor,</div><div class='line' id='LC91'>and the restfulness of his company--for he did all the talking.</div><div class='line' id='LC92'>We fell together, as modest people will, in the tail of the herd</div><div class='line' id='LC93'>that was being shown through, and he at once began to say things</div><div class='line' id='LC94'>which interested me.  As he talked along, softly, pleasantly,</div><div class='line' id='LC95'>flowingly, he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world</div><div class='line' id='LC96'>and time, and into some remote era and old forgotten country;</div><div class='line' id='LC97'>and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that I seemed</div><div class='line' id='LC98'>to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray</div><div class='line' id='LC99'>antiquity, holding speech with a relic of it!  Exactly as I would</div><div class='line' id='LC100'>speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies, or my most familiar</div><div class='line' id='LC101'>neighbors, he spoke of Sir Bedivere, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Launcelot</div><div class='line' id='LC102'>of the Lake, Sir Galahad, and all the other great names of the</div><div class='line' id='LC103'>Table Round--and how old, old, unspeakably old and faded and dry</div><div class='line' id='LC104'>and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on!  Presently</div><div class='line' id='LC105'>he turned to me and said, just as one might speak of the weather,</div><div class='line' id='LC106'>or any other common matter--</div><div class='line' id='LC107'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC108'>&quot;You know about transmigration of souls; do you know about</div><div class='line' id='LC109'>transposition of epochs--and bodies?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC110'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC111'>I said I had not heard of it.

From time to</div><div class='line' id='LC137'>time I dipped into old Sir Thomas Malory&#39;s enchanting book, and</div><div class='line' id='LC138'>fed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures, breathed in</div><div class='line' id='LC139'>the fragrance of its obsolete names, and dreamed again.  Midnight</div><div class='line' id='LC140'>being come at length, I read another tale, for a nightcap--this</div><div class='line' id='LC141'>which here follows, to wit:</div><div class='line' id='LC142'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC143'>HOW SIR LAUNCELOT SLEW TWO GIANTS, AND MADE A CASTLE FREE</div><div class='line' id='LC144'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC145'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon withal came there upon him two great giants,</div><div class='line' id='LC146'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well armed, all save the heads, with two horrible</div><div class='line' id='LC147'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clubs in their hands.  Sir Launcelot put his shield</div><div class='line' id='LC148'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afore him, and put the stroke away of the one</div><div class='line' id='LC149'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;giant, and with his sword he clave his head asunder.</div><div class='line' id='LC150'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his fellow saw that, he ran away as he were</div><div class='line' id='LC151'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wood [*demented], for fear of the horrible strokes,</div><div class='line' id='LC152'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sir Launcelot after him with all his might,</div><div class='line' id='LC153'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to</div><div class='line' id='LC154'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the middle.  Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall,</div><div class='line' id='LC155'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there came afore him three score ladies and</div><div class='line' id='LC156'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damsels, and all kneeled unto him, and thanked</div><div class='line' id='LC157'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God and him of their deliverance.  For, sir, said</div><div class='line' id='LC158'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they, the most part of us have been here this</div><div class='line' id='LC159'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven year their prisoners, and we have worked all</div><div class='line' id='LC160'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all</div><div class='line' id='LC161'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great gentle-women born, and blessed be the time,</div><div class='line' id='LC162'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knight, that ever thou wert born; for thou hast</div><div class='line' id='LC163'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done the most worship that ever did knight in the</div><div class='line' id='LC164'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world, that will we bear record, and we all pray</div><div class='line' id='LC165'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you to tell us your name, that we may tell our</div><div class='line' id='LC166'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friends who delivered us out of prison.  Fair</div><div class='line' id='LC167'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damsels, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du</div><div class='line' id='LC168'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake.  And so he departed from them and betaught</div><div class='line' id='LC169'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them unto God.  And then he mounted upon his</div><div class='line' id='LC170'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horse, and rode into many strange and wild</div><div class='line' id='LC171'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;countries, and through many waters and valleys,</div><div class='line' id='LC172'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and evil was he lodged.  And at the last by</div><div class='line' id='LC173'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fortune him happened against a night to come to</div><div class='line' id='LC174'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fair courtilage, and therein he found an old</div><div class='line' id='LC175'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gentle-woman that lodged him with a good-will,</div><div class='line' id='LC176'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there he had good cheer for him and his horse.</div><div class='line' id='LC177'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when time was, his host brought him into a</div><div class='line' id='LC178'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fair garret over the gate to his bed. There</div><div class='line' id='LC179'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness</div><div class='line' id='LC180'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell on</div><div class='line' id='LC181'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep. So, soon after there came one on</div><div class='line' id='LC182'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horseback, and knocked at the gate in great</div><div class='line' id='LC183'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haste.  And when Sir Launcelot heard this he rose</div><div class='line' id='LC184'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up, and looked out at the window, and saw by the</div><div class='line' id='LC185'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moonlight three knights come riding after that</div><div class='line' id='LC186'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one man, and all three lashed on him at once</div><div class='line' id='LC187'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with swords, and that one knight turned on them</div><div class='line' id='LC188'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knightly again and defended him. Truly, said</div><div class='line' id='LC189'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launcelot, yonder one knight shall I help,</div><div class='line' id='LC190'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it were shame for me to see three knights</div><div class='line' id='LC191'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on one, and if he be slain I am partner of his</div><div class='line' id='LC192'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death.  And therewith he took his harness and</div><div class='line' id='LC193'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went out at a window by a sheet down to the four</div><div class='line' id='LC194'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high,</div><div class='line' id='LC195'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn you knights unto me, and leave your</div><div class='line' id='LC196'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fighting with that knight. And then they all</div><div class='line' id='LC197'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot,</div><div class='line' id='LC198'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there began great battle, for they alight</div><div class='line' id='LC199'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all three, and strake many strokes at Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC200'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then</div><div class='line' id='LC201'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Kay dressed him for to have holpen Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC202'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launcelot.  Nay, sir, said he, I will none of</div><div class='line' id='LC203'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your help, therefore as ye will have my help</div><div class='line' id='LC204'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me alone with them.  Sir Kay for the pleasure</div><div class='line' id='LC205'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the knight suffered him for to do his will,</div><div class='line' id='LC206'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so stood aside. And then anon within six</div><div class='line' id='LC207'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strokes Sir Launcelot had stricken them to the earth.</div><div class='line' id='LC208'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC209'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they all three cried, Sir Knight, we</div><div class='line' id='LC210'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yield us unto you as man of might matchless.  As</div><div class='line' id='LC211'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take</div><div class='line' id='LC212'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your yielding unto me, but so that ye yield</div><div class='line' id='LC213'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you unto Sir Kay the seneschal, on that covenant</div><div class='line' id='LC214'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will save your lives and else not.  Fair knight,</div><div class='line' id='LC215'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said they, that were we loath to do; for as for</div><div class='line' id='LC216'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Kay we chased him hither, and had overcome</div><div class='line' id='LC217'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him had ye not been; therefore, to yield us unto</div><div class='line' id='LC218'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him it were no reason.  Well, as to that, said</div><div class='line' id='LC219'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launcelot, advise you well, for ye may</div><div class='line' id='LC220'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be</div><div class='line' id='LC221'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yielden, it shall be unto Sir Kay.  Fair knight,</div><div class='line' id='LC222'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then they said, in saving our lives we will do</div><div class='line' id='LC223'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as thou commandest us.  Then shall ye, said Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC224'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming go unto the</div><div class='line' id='LC225'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;court of King Arthur, and there shall ye yield</div><div class='line' id='LC226'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you unto Queen Guenever, and put you all three</div><div class='line' id='LC227'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay</div><div class='line' id='LC228'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent you thither to be her prisoners.  On the morn</div><div class='line' id='LC229'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay</div><div class='line' id='LC230'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleeping; and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay&#39;s armor</div><div class='line' id='LC231'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his shield and armed him, and so he went to</div><div class='line' id='LC232'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stable and took his horse, and took his leave</div><div class='line' id='LC233'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his host, and so he departed.  Then soon after</div><div class='line' id='LC234'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot; and</div><div class='line' id='LC235'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then he espied that he had his armor and his</div><div class='line' id='LC236'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horse. Now by my faith I know well that he will</div><div class='line' id='LC237'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grieve some of the court of King Arthur; for on</div><div class='line' id='LC238'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I,</div><div class='line' id='LC239'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that will beguile them; and because of his</div><div class='line' id='LC240'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;armor and shield I am sure I shall ride in peace.</div><div class='line' id='LC241'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then soon after departed Sir Kay, and</div><div class='line' id='LC242'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanked his host.</div><div class='line' id='LC243'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC244'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC245'>As I laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and my</div><div class='line' id='LC246'>stranger came in.  I gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him</div><div class='line' id='LC247'>welcome.  I also comforted him with a hot Scotch whisky; gave him</div><div class='line' id='LC248'>another one; then still another--hoping always for his story.</div><div class='line' id='LC249'>After a fourth persuader, he drifted into it himself, in a quite</div><div class='line' id='LC250'>simple and natural way:</div><div class='line' id='LC251'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC252'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC253'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC254'>THE STRANGER&#39;S HISTORY</div><div class='line' id='LC255'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC256'>I am an American.  I was born and reared in Hartford, in the State</div><div class='line' id='LC257'>of Connecticut--anyway, just over the river, in the country.  So</div><div class='line' id='LC258'>I am a Yankee of the Yankees--and practical; yes, and nearly</div><div class='line' id='LC259'>barren of sentiment, I suppose--or poetry, in other words.  My</div><div class='line' id='LC260'>father was a blacksmith, my uncle was a horse doctor, and I was</div><div class='line' id='LC261'>both, along at first.  Then I went over to the great arms factory</div><div class='line' id='LC262'>and learned my real trade; learned all there was to it; learned</div><div class='line' id='LC263'>to make everything: guns, revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, all</div><div class='line' id='LC264'>sorts of labor-saving machinery.  Why, I could make anything</div><div class='line' id='LC265'>a body wanted--anything in the world, it didn&#39;t make any difference</div><div class='line' id='LC266'>what; and if there wasn&#39;t any quick new-fangled way to make a thing,</div><div class='line' id='LC267'>I could invent one--and do it as easy as rolling off a log.  I became</div><div class='line' id='LC268'>head superintendent; had a couple of thousand men under me.</div><div class='line' id='LC269'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC270'>Well, a man like that is a man that is full of fight--that goes</div><div class='line' id='LC271'>without saying.  With a couple of thousand rough men under one,</div><div class='line' id='LC272'>one has plenty of that sort of amusement.  I had, anyway.  At last</div><div class='line' id='LC273'>I met my match, and I got my dose.  It was during a misunderstanding</div><div class='line' id='LC274'>conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call Hercules.</div><div class='line' id='LC275'>He laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made everything</div><div class='line' id='LC276'>crack, and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it</div><div class='line' id='LC277'>overlap its neighbor.  Then the world went out in darkness, and</div><div class='line' id='LC278'>I didn&#39;t feel anything more, and didn&#39;t know anything at all</div><div class='line' id='LC279'>--at least for a while.</div><div class='line' id='LC280'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC281'>When I came to again, I was sitting under an oak tree, on the</div><div class='line' id='LC282'>grass, with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all</div><div class='line' id='LC283'>to myself--nearly.  Not entirely; for there was a fellow on a horse,</div><div class='line' id='LC284'>looking down at me--a fellow fresh out of a picture-book.  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC285'>in old-time iron armor from head to heel, with a helmet on his</div><div class='line' id='LC286'>head the shape of a nail-keg with slits in it; and he had a shield,</div><div class='line' id='LC287'>and a sword, and a prodigious spear; and his horse had armor on,</div><div class='line' id='LC288'>too, and a steel horn projecting from his forehead, and gorgeous</div><div class='line' id='LC289'>red and green silk trappings that hung down all around him like</div><div class='line' id='LC290'>a bedquilt, nearly to the ground.</div><div class='line' id='LC291'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC292'>&quot;Fair sir, will ye just?&quot; said this fellow.</div><div class='line' id='LC293'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC294'>&quot;Will I which?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC295'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC296'>&quot;Will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC297'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC298'>&quot;What are you giving me?&quot; I said.  &quot;Get along back to your circus,</div><div class='line' id='LC299'>or I&#39;ll report you.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC300'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC301'>Now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards</div><div class='line' id='LC302'>and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear, with his</div><div class='line' id='LC303'>nail-keg bent down nearly to his horse&#39;s neck and his long spear</div><div class='line' id='LC304'>pointed straight ahead.  I saw he meant business, so I was up</div><div class='line' id='LC305'>the tree when he arrived.</div><div class='line' id='LC306'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC307'>He allowed that I was his property, the captive of his spear.</div><div class='line' id='LC308'>There was argument on his side--and the bulk of the advantage</div><div class='line' id='LC309'>--so I judged it best to humor him.  We fixed up an agreement</div><div class='line' id='LC310'>whereby I was to go with him and he was not to hurt me.  I came</div><div class='line' id='LC311'>down, and we started away, I walking by the side of his horse.</div><div class='line' id='LC312'>We marched comfortably along, through glades and over brooks which</div><div class='line' id='LC313'>I could not remember to have seen before--which puzzled me and</div><div class='line' id='LC314'>made me wonder--and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of</div><div class='line' id='LC315'>a circus.  So I gave up the idea of a circus, and concluded he was</div><div class='line' id='LC316'>from an asylum.  But we never came to an asylum--so I was up</div><div class='line' id='LC317'>a stump, as you may say.  I asked him how far we were from Hartford.</div><div class='line' id='LC318'>He said he had never heard of the place; which I took to be a lie,</div><div class='line' id='LC319'>but allowed it to go at that.  At the end of an hour we saw a</div><div class='line' id='LC320'>far-away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river; and beyond</div><div class='line' id='LC321'>it on a hill, a vast gray fortress, with towers and turrets,</div><div class='line' id='LC322'>the first I had ever seen out of a picture.</div><div class='line' id='LC323'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC324'>&quot;Bridgeport?&quot; said I, pointing.</div><div class='line' id='LC325'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC326'>&quot;Camelot,&quot; said he.</div><div class='line' id='LC327'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC328'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC329'>My stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness.  He caught</div><div class='line' id='LC330'>himself nodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsolete</div><div class='line' id='LC331'>smiles of his, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC332'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC333'>&quot;I find I can&#39;t go on; but come with me, I&#39;ve got it all written</div><div class='line' id='LC334'>out, and you can read it if you like.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC335'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC336'>In his chamber, he said: &quot;First, I kept a journal; then by and by,</div><div class='line' id='LC337'>after years, I took the journal and turned it into a book. How</div><div class='line' id='LC338'>long ago that was!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC339'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC340'>He handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place where</div><div class='line' id='LC341'>I should begin:</div><div class='line' id='LC342'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC343'>&quot;Begin here--I&#39;ve already told you what goes before.&quot;  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC344'>steeped in drowsiness by this time.

The first part</div><div class='line' id='LC348'>of it--the great bulk of it--was parchment, and yellow with age.</div><div class='line' id='LC349'>I scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest.</div><div class='line' id='LC350'>Under the old dim writing of the Yankee historian appeared traces</div><div class='line' id='LC351'>of a penmanship which was older and dimmer still--Latin words</div><div class='line' id='LC352'>and sentences: fragments from old monkish legends, evidently.</div><div class='line' id='LC353'>I turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read</div><div class='line' id='LC354'>--as follows:</div><div class='line' id='LC355'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC356'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC357'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC358'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC359'>THE TALE OF THE LOST LAND</div><div class='line' id='LC360'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC361'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC362'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC363'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC364'>CHAPTER I</div><div class='line' id='LC365'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC366'>CAMELOT</div><div class='line' id='LC367'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC368'>&quot;Camelot--Camelot,&quot; said I to myself.  &quot;I don&#39;t seem to remember</div><div class='line' id='LC369'>hearing of it before.

The air was full of the smell of</div><div class='line' id='LC373'>flowers, and the buzzing of insects, and the twittering of birds,</div><div class='line' id='LC374'>and there were no people, no wagons, there was no stir of life,</div><div class='line' id='LC375'>nothing going on.  The road was mainly a winding path with hoof-prints</div><div class='line' id='LC376'>in it, and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in</div><div class='line' id='LC377'>the grass--wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as one&#39;s hand.</div><div class='line' id='LC378'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC379'>Presently a fair slip of a girl, about ten years old, with a cataract</div><div class='line' id='LC380'>of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders, came along.</div><div class='line' id='LC381'>Around her head she wore a hoop of flame-red poppies. It was as</div><div class='line' id='LC382'>sweet an outfit as ever I saw, what there was of it.  She walked</div><div class='line' id='LC383'>indolently along, with a mind at rest, its peace reflected in her</div><div class='line' id='LC384'>innocent face.  The circus man paid no attention to her; didn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC385'>even seem to see her.  And she--she was no more startled at his</div><div class='line' id='LC386'>fantastic make-up than if she was used to his like every day of</div><div class='line' id='LC387'>her life.  She was going by as indifferently as she might have gone</div><div class='line' id='LC388'>by a couple of cows; but when she happened to notice me, _then_</div><div class='line' id='LC389'>there was a change!  Up went her hands, and she was turned to stone;</div><div class='line' id='LC390'>her mouth dropped open, her eyes stared wide and timorously, she</div><div class='line' id='LC391'>was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC392'>there she stood gazing, in a sort of stupefied fascination, till</div><div class='line' id='LC393'>we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view.  That</div><div class='line' id='LC394'>she should be startled at me instead of at the other man, was too</div><div class='line' id='LC395'>many for me; I couldn&#39;t make head or tail of it.  And that she</div><div class='line' id='LC396'>should seem to consider me a spectacle, and totally overlook her</div><div class='line' id='LC397'>own merits in that respect, was another puzzling thing, and a</div><div class='line' id='LC398'>display of magnanimity, too, that was surprising in one so young.</div><div class='line' id='LC399'>There was food for thought here.  I moved along as one in a dream.</div><div class='line' id='LC400'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC401'>As we approached the town, signs of life began to appear.  At</div><div class='line' id='LC402'>intervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, and</div><div class='line' id='LC403'>about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of</div><div class='line' id='LC404'>cultivation.  There were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse,</div><div class='line' id='LC405'>uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look</div><div class='line' id='LC406'>like animals.  They and the women, as a rule, wore a coarse</div><div class='line' id='LC407'>tow-linen robe that came well below the knee, and a rude sort of</div><div class='line' id='LC408'>sandal, and many wore an iron collar.  The small boys and girls</div><div class='line' id='LC409'>were always naked; but nobody seemed to know it.  All of these</div><div class='line' id='LC410'>people stared at me, talked about me, ran into the huts and fetched</div><div class='line' id='LC411'>out their families to gape at me; but nobody ever noticed that</div><div class='line' id='LC412'>other fellow, except to make him humble salutation and get no</div><div class='line' id='LC413'>response for their pains.</div><div class='line' id='LC414'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC415'>In the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone</div><div class='line' id='LC416'>scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins; the streets were</div><div class='line' id='LC417'>mere crooked alleys, and unpaved; troops of dogs and nude children</div><div class='line' id='LC418'>played in the sun and made life and noise; hogs roamed and rooted</div><div class='line' id='LC419'>contentedly about, and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in</div><div class='line' id='LC420'>the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family.</div><div class='line' id='LC421'>Presently there was a distant blare of military music; it came</div><div class='line' id='LC422'>nearer, still nearer, and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view,</div><div class='line' id='LC423'>glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners</div><div class='line' id='LC424'>and rich doublets and horse-cloths and gilded spearheads; and</div><div class='line' id='LC425'>through the muck and swine, and naked brats, and joyous dogs, and</div><div class='line' id='LC426'>shabby huts, it took its gallant way, and in its wake we followed.</div><div class='line' id='LC427'>Followed through one winding alley and then another,--and climbing,</div><div class='line' id='LC428'>always climbing--till at last we gained the breezy height where</div><div class='line' id='LC429'>the huge castle stood.

I judged I had found one, presently;</div><div class='line' id='LC464'>so I drew him aside and said in his ear:</div><div class='line' id='LC465'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC466'>&quot;If I could see the head keeper a minute--only just a minute--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC467'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC468'>&quot;Prithee do not let me.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC469'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC470'>&quot;Let you _what_?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC471'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC472'>&quot;_Hinder_ me, then, if the word please thee better.  Then he went</div><div class='line' id='LC473'>on to say he was an under-cook and could not stop to gossip,</div><div class='line' id='LC474'>though he would like it another time; for it would comfort his</div><div class='line' id='LC475'>very liver to know where I got my clothes.  As he started away he</div><div class='line' id='LC476'>pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose,</div><div class='line' id='LC477'>and was seeking me besides, no doubt.  This was an airy slim boy</div><div class='line' id='LC478'>in shrimp-colored tights that made him look like a forked carrot,</div><div class='line' id='LC479'>the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles;</div><div class='line' id='LC480'>and he had long yellow curls, and wore a plumed pink satin cap</div><div class='line' id='LC481'>tilted complacently over his ear.  By his look, he was good-natured;</div><div class='line' id='LC482'>by his gait, he was satisfied with himself.  He was pretty enough</div><div class='line' id='LC483'>to frame.  He arrived, looked me over with a smiling and impudent</div><div class='line' id='LC484'>curiosity; said he had come for me, and informed me that he was a page.</div><div class='line' id='LC485'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC486'>&quot;Go &#39;long,&quot; I said; &quot;you ain&#39;t more than a paragraph.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC487'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC488'>It was pretty severe, but I was nettled.  However, it never phazed</div><div class='line' id='LC489'>him; he didn&#39;t appear to know he was hurt.  He began to talk and</div><div class='line' id='LC490'>laugh, in happy, thoughtless, boyish fashion, as we walked along,</div><div class='line' id='LC491'>and made himself old friends with me at once; asked me all sorts</div><div class='line' id='LC492'>of questions about myself and about my clothes, but never waited</div><div class='line' id='LC493'>for an answer--always chattered straight ahead, as if he didn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC494'>know he had asked a question and wasn&#39;t expecting any reply, until</div><div class='line' id='LC495'>at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning</div><div class='line' id='LC496'>of the year 513.</div><div class='line' id='LC497'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC498'>It made the cold chills creep over me!

They will not</div><div class='line' id='LC535'>be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC536'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC537'>I seemed to believe the boy, I didn&#39;t know why.  _Something_ in me</div><div class='line' id='LC538'>seemed to believe him--my consciousness, as you may say; but my</div><div class='line' id='LC539'>reason didn&#39;t.  My reason straightway began to clamor; that was</div><div class='line' id='LC540'>natural.  I didn&#39;t know how to go about satisfying it, because</div><div class='line' id='LC541'>I knew that the testimony of men wouldn&#39;t serve--my reason would</div><div class='line' id='LC542'>say they were lunatics, and throw out their evidence.  But all</div><div class='line' id='LC543'>of a sudden I stumbled on the very thing, just by luck.  I knew</div><div class='line' id='LC544'>that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the</div><div class='line' id='LC545'>sixth century occurred on the 21st of June, A.D. 528, O.S., and</div><div class='line' id='LC546'>began at 3 minutes after 12 noon.  I also knew that no total eclipse</div><div class='line' id='LC547'>of the sun was due in what to _me_ was the present year--i.e., 1879.</div><div class='line' id='LC548'>So, if I could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart</div><div class='line' id='LC549'>out of me for forty-eight hours, I should then find out for certain</div><div class='line' id='LC550'>whether this boy was telling me the truth or not.</div><div class='line' id='LC551'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC552'>Wherefore, being a practical Connecticut man, I now shoved this</div><div class='line' id='LC553'>whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour</div><div class='line' id='LC554'>should come, in order that I might turn all my attention to the</div><div class='line' id='LC555'>circumstances of the present moment, and be alert and ready to</div><div class='line' id='LC556'>make the most out of them that could be made.  One thing at a time,</div><div class='line' id='LC557'>is my motto--and just play that thing for all it is worth, even</div><div class='line' id='LC558'>if it&#39;s only two pair and a jack.  I made up my mind to two things:</div><div class='line' id='LC559'>if it was still the nineteenth century and I was among lunatics</div><div class='line' id='LC560'>and couldn&#39;t get away, I would presently boss that asylum or know</div><div class='line' id='LC561'>the reason why; and if, on the other hand, it was really the sixth</div><div class='line' id='LC562'>century, all right, I didn&#39;t want any softer thing: I would boss</div><div class='line' id='LC563'>the whole country inside of three months; for I judged I would</div><div class='line' id='LC564'>have the start of the best-educated man in the kingdom by a matter</div><div class='line' id='LC565'>of thirteen hundred years and upward.  I&#39;m not a man to waste</div><div class='line' id='LC566'>time after my mind&#39;s made up and there&#39;s work on hand; so I said</div><div class='line' id='LC567'>to the page:</div><div class='line' id='LC568'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC569'>&quot;Now, Clarence, my boy--if that might happen to be your name</div><div class='line' id='LC570'>--I&#39;ll get you to post me up a little if you don&#39;t mind.

I saw that the last chance had the best</div><div class='line' id='LC583'>show, but I didn&#39;t waste any bother about that; time was too</div><div class='line' id='LC584'>precious.  The page said, further, that dinner was about ended</div><div class='line' id='LC585'>in the great hall by this time, and that as soon as the sociability</div><div class='line' id='LC586'>and the heavy drinking should begin, Sir Kay would have me in and</div><div class='line' id='LC587'>exhibit me before King Arthur and his illustrious knights seated at</div><div class='line' id='LC588'>the Table Round, and would brag about his exploit in capturing</div><div class='line' id='LC589'>me, and would probably exaggerate the facts a little, but it</div><div class='line' id='LC590'>wouldn&#39;t be good form for me to correct him, and not over safe,</div><div class='line' id='LC591'>either; and when I was done being exhibited, then ho for the</div><div class='line' id='LC592'>dungeon; but he, Clarence, would find a way to come and see me every</div><div class='line' id='LC593'>now and then, and cheer me up, and help me get word to my friends.</div><div class='line' id='LC594'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC595'>Get word to my friends!

The floor was of big stone flags laid in black and</div><div class='line' id='LC606'>white squares, rather battered by age and use, and needing repair.</div><div class='line' id='LC607'>As to ornament, there wasn&#39;t any, strictly speaking; though on</div><div class='line' id='LC608'>the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed</div><div class='line' id='LC609'>as works of art; battle-pieces, they were, with horses shaped like</div><div class='line' id='LC610'>those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread;</div><div class='line' id='LC611'>with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by</div><div class='line' id='LC612'>round holes--so that the man&#39;s coat looks as if it had been done</div><div class='line' id='LC613'>with a biscuit-punch.  There was a fireplace big enough to camp in;</div><div class='line' id='LC614'>and its projecting sides and hood, of carved and pillared stonework,</div><div class='line' id='LC615'>had the look of a cathedral door.  Along the walls stood men-at-arms,</div><div class='line' id='LC616'>in breastplate and morion, with halberds for their only weapon</div><div class='line' id='LC617'>--rigid as statues; and that is what they looked like.</div><div class='line' id='LC618'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC619'>In the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken</div><div class='line' id='LC620'>table which they called the Table Round.  It was as large as</div><div class='line' id='LC621'>a circus ring; and around it sat a great company of men dressed</div><div class='line' id='LC622'>in such various and splendid colors that it hurt one&#39;s eyes to look</div><div class='line' id='LC623'>at them.  They wore their plumed hats, right along, except that</div><div class='line' id='LC624'>whenever one addressed himself directly to the king, he lifted</div><div class='line' id='LC625'>his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark.</div><div class='line' id='LC626'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC627'>Mainly they were drinking--from entire ox horns; but a few were</div><div class='line' id='LC628'>still munching bread or gnawing beef bones.  There was about</div><div class='line' id='LC629'>an average of two dogs to one man; and these sat in expectant</div><div class='line' id='LC630'>attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them, and then they went</div><div class='line' id='LC631'>for it by brigades and divisions, with a rush, and there ensued</div><div class='line' id='LC632'>a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of</div><div class='line' id='LC633'>plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails, and the storm of</div><div class='line' id='LC634'>howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time; but that</div><div class='line' id='LC635'>was no matter, for the dog-fight was always a bigger interest</div><div class='line' id='LC636'>anyway; the men rose, sometimes, to observe it the better and bet</div><div class='line' id='LC637'>on it, and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out</div><div class='line' id='LC638'>over their balusters with the same object; and all broke into</div><div class='line' id='LC639'>delighted ejaculations from time to time. In the end, the winning</div><div class='line' id='LC640'>dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his</div><div class='line' id='LC641'>paws, and proceeded to growl over it, and gnaw it, and grease</div><div class='line' id='LC642'>the floor with it, just as fifty others were already doing; and the</div><div class='line' id='LC643'>rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments.</div><div class='line' id='LC644'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC645'>As a rule, the speech and behavior of these people were gracious</div><div class='line' id='LC646'>and courtly; and I noticed that they were good and serious listeners</div><div class='line' id='LC647'>when anybody was telling anything--I mean in a dog-fightless</div><div class='line' id='LC648'>interval.  And plainly, too, they were a childlike and innocent lot;</div><div class='line' id='LC649'>telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and</div><div class='line' id='LC650'>winning naivety, and ready and willing to listen to anybody else&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC651'>lie, and believe it, too.  It was hard to associate them with</div><div class='line' id='LC652'>anything cruel or dreadful; and yet they dealt in tales of blood</div><div class='line' id='LC653'>and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget</div><div class='line' id='LC654'>to shudder.</div><div class='line' id='LC655'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC656'>I was not the only prisoner present.  There were twenty or more.</div><div class='line' id='LC657'>Poor devils, many of them were maimed, hacked, carved, in a frightful</div><div class='line' id='LC658'>way; and their hair, their faces, their clothing, were caked with</div><div class='line' id='LC659'>black and stiffened drenchings of blood.  They were suffering</div><div class='line' id='LC660'>sharp physical pain, of course; and weariness, and hunger and</div><div class='line' id='LC661'>thirst, no doubt; and at least none had given them the comfort</div><div class='line' id='LC662'>of a wash, or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds;</div><div class='line' id='LC663'>yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan, or saw them show</div><div class='line' id='LC664'>any sign of restlessness, or any disposition to complain.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC665'>thought was forced upon me: &quot;The rascals--_they_ have served other</div><div class='line' id='LC666'>people so in their day; it being their own turn, now, they were</div><div class='line' id='LC667'>not expecting any better treatment than this; so their philosophical</div><div class='line' id='LC668'>bearing is not an outcome of mental training, intellectual fortitude,</div><div class='line' id='LC669'>reasoning; it is mere animal training; they are white Indians.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC670'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC671'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC672'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC673'>CHAPTER III</div><div class='line' id='LC674'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC675'>KNIGHTS OF THE TABLE ROUND</div><div class='line' id='LC676'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC677'>Mainly the Round Table talk was monologues--narrative accounts</div><div class='line' id='LC678'>of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their</div><div class='line' id='LC679'>friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor.</div><div class='line' id='LC680'>As a general thing--as far as I could make out--these murderous</div><div class='line' id='LC681'>adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to</div><div class='line' id='LC682'>settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were</div><div class='line' id='LC683'>simply duels between strangers--duels between people who had never</div><div class='line' id='LC684'>even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no</div><div class='line' id='LC685'>cause of offense whatever.  Many a time I had seen a couple of boys,</div><div class='line' id='LC686'>strangers, meet by chance, and say simultaneously, &quot;I can lick you,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC687'>and go at it on the spot; but I had always imagined until now that</div><div class='line' id='LC688'>that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and</div><div class='line' id='LC689'>mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it</div><div class='line' id='LC690'>and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond.  Yet there</div><div class='line' id='LC691'>was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted</div><div class='line' id='LC692'>creatures, something attractive and lovable.  There did not seem</div><div class='line' id='LC693'>to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait</div><div class='line' id='LC694'>a fish-hook with; but you didn&#39;t seem to mind that, after a little,</div><div class='line' id='LC695'>because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society</div><div class='line' id='LC696'>like that, and indeed would have marred it, hindered it, spoiled</div><div class='line' id='LC697'>its symmetry--perhaps rendered its existence impossible.</div><div class='line' id='LC698'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC699'>There was a fine manliness observable in almost every face; and</div><div class='line' id='LC700'>in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your</div><div class='line' id='LC701'>belittling criticisms and stilled them.  A most noble benignity</div><div class='line' id='LC702'>and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called Sir Galahad,</div><div class='line' id='LC703'>and likewise in the king&#39;s also; and there was majesty and greatness</div><div class='line' id='LC704'>in the giant frame and high bearing of Sir Launcelot of the Lake.</div><div class='line' id='LC705'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC706'>There was presently an incident which centered the general interest</div><div class='line' id='LC707'>upon this Sir Launcelot.  At a sign from a sort of master of</div><div class='line' id='LC708'>ceremonies, six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward</div><div class='line' id='LC709'>in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward</div><div class='line' id='LC710'>the ladies&#39; gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen.</div><div class='line' id='LC711'>The most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower-bed</div><div class='line' id='LC712'>of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent,</div><div class='line' id='LC713'>and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his</div><div class='line' id='LC714'>fellows into her hands for free pardon, ransom, captivity, or death,</div><div class='line' id='LC715'>as she in her good pleasure might elect; and this, as he said, he</div><div class='line' id='LC716'>was doing by command of Sir Kay the Seneschal, whose prisoners</div><div class='line' id='LC717'>they were, he having vanquished them by his single might and</div><div class='line' id='LC718'>prowess in sturdy conflict in the field.</div><div class='line' id='LC719'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC720'>Surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over</div><div class='line' id='LC721'>the house; the queen&#39;s gratified smile faded out at the name of</div><div class='line' id='LC722'>Sir Kay, and she looked disappointed; and the page whispered in</div><div class='line' id='LC723'>my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision--</div><div class='line' id='LC724'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC725'>&quot;Sir _Kay_, forsooth!  Oh, call me pet names, dearest, call me</div><div class='line' id='LC726'>a marine!  In twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention</div><div class='line' id='LC727'>of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC728'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC729'>Every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon Sir Kay. But he</div><div class='line' id='LC730'>was equal to the occasion.  He got up and played his hand like</div><div class='line' id='LC731'>a major--and took every trick.  He said he would state the case</div><div class='line' id='LC732'>exactly according to the facts; he would tell the simple</div><div class='line' id='LC733'>straightforward tale, without comment of his own; &quot;and then,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC734'>said he, &quot;if ye find glory and honor due, ye will give it unto him</div><div class='line' id='LC735'>who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or</div><div class='line' id='LC736'>strake with sword in the ranks of Christian battle--even him that</div><div class='line' id='LC737'>sitteth there!&quot; and he pointed to Sir Launcelot.  Ah, he fetched</div><div class='line' id='LC738'>them; it was a rattling good stroke.  Then he went on and told</div><div class='line' id='LC739'>how Sir Launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by,</div><div class='line' id='LC740'>killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set a hundred</div><div class='line' id='LC741'>and forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, still</div><div class='line' id='LC742'>seeking adventures, and found him (Sir Kay) fighting a desperate</div><div class='line' id='LC743'>fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle</div><div class='line' id='LC744'>solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night</div><div class='line' id='LC745'>Sir Launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in Sir Kay&#39;s armor and</div><div class='line' id='LC746'>took Sir Kay&#39;s horse and gat him away into distant lands, and</div><div class='line' id='LC747'>vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four</div><div class='line' id='LC748'>in another; and all these and the former nine he made to swear</div><div class='line' id='LC749'>that about Whitsuntide they would ride to Arthur&#39;s court and yield</div><div class='line' id='LC750'>them to Queen Guenever&#39;s hands as captives of Sir Kay the Seneschal,</div><div class='line' id='LC751'>spoil of his knightly prowess; and now here were these half dozen,</div><div class='line' id='LC752'>and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of</div><div class='line' id='LC753'>their desperate wounds.</div><div class='line' id='LC754'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC755'>Well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and look</div><div class='line' id='LC756'>embarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at Sir Launcelot</div><div class='line' id='LC757'>that would have got him shot in Arkansas, to a dead certainty.</div><div class='line' id='LC758'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC759'>Everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of Sir Launcelot; and</div><div class='line' id='LC760'>as for me, I was perfectly amazed, that one man, all by himself,</div><div class='line' id='LC761'>should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions</div><div class='line' id='LC762'>of practiced fighters.  I said as much to Clarence; but this mocking</div><div class='line' id='LC763'>featherhead only said:</div><div class='line' id='LC764'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC765'>&quot;An Sir Kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him,</div><div class='line' id='LC766'>ye had seen the accompt doubled.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC767'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC768'>I looked at the boy in sorrow; and as I looked I saw the cloud of</div><div class='line' id='LC769'>a deep despondency settle upon his countenance.  I followed the</div><div class='line' id='LC770'>direction of his eye, and saw that a very old and white-bearded</div><div class='line' id='LC771'>man, clothed in a flowing black gown, had risen and was standing</div><div class='line' id='LC772'>at the table upon unsteady legs, and feebly swaying his ancient</div><div class='line' id='LC773'>head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye.</div><div class='line' id='LC774'>The same suffering look that was in the page&#39;s face was observable</div><div class='line' id='LC775'>in all the faces around--the look of dumb creatures who know that</div><div class='line' id='LC776'>they must endure and make no moan.</div><div class='line' id='LC777'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC778'>&quot;Marry, we shall have it again,&quot; sighed the boy; &quot;that same old</div><div class='line' id='LC779'>weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words,</div><div class='line' id='LC780'>and that he _will_ tell till he dieth, every time he hath gotten his</div><div class='line' id='LC781'>barrel full and feeleth his exaggeration-mill a-working.  Would</div><div class='line' id='LC782'>God I had died or I saw this day!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC783'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC784'>&quot;Who is it?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC785'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC786'>&quot;Merlin, the mighty liar and magician, perdition singe him for</div><div class='line' id='LC787'>the weariness he worketh with his one tale!  But that men fear</div><div class='line' id='LC788'>him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the</div><div class='line' id='LC789'>devils that be in hell at his beck and call, they would have dug</div><div class='line' id='LC790'>his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and</div><div class='line' id='LC791'>squelch it.  He telleth it always in the third person, making</div><div class='line' id='LC792'>believe he is too modest to glorify himself--maledictions light</div><div class='line' id='LC793'>upon him, misfortune be his dole!  Good friend, prithee call me</div><div class='line' id='LC794'>for evensong.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC795'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC796'>The boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go</div><div class='line' id='LC797'>to sleep.  The old man began his tale; and presently the lad was</div><div class='line' id='LC798'>asleep in reality; so also were the dogs, and the court, the lackeys,</div><div class='line' id='LC799'>and the files of men-at-arms.  The droning voice droned on; a soft</div><div class='line' id='LC800'>snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued</div><div class='line' id='LC801'>accompaniment of wind instruments.  Some heads were bowed upon</div><div class='line' id='LC802'>folded arms, some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious</div><div class='line' id='LC803'>music; the flies buzzed and bit, unmolested, the rats swarmed</div><div class='line' id='LC804'>softly out from a hundred holes, and pattered about, and made</div><div class='line' id='LC805'>themselves at home everywhere; and one of them sat up like a</div><div class='line' id='LC806'>squirrel on the king&#39;s head and held a bit of cheese in its hands</div><div class='line' id='LC807'>and nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the king&#39;s face with</div><div class='line' id='LC808'>naive and impudent irreverence.  It was a tranquil scene, and</div><div class='line' id='LC809'>restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit.</div><div class='line' id='LC810'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC811'>This was the old man&#39;s tale.  He said:</div><div class='line' id='LC812'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC813'>&quot;Right so the king and Merlin departed, and went until an hermit</div><div class='line' id='LC814'>that was a good man and a great leech.  So the hermit searched</div><div class='line' id='LC815'>all his wounds and gave him good salves; so the king was there</div><div class='line' id='LC816'>three days, and then were his wounds well amended that he might</div><div class='line' id='LC817'>ride and go, and so departed.  And as they rode, Arthur said,</div><div class='line' id='LC818'>I have no sword.  No force,* [*Footnote from M.T.: No matter.]</div><div class='line' id='LC819'>said Merlin, hereby is a sword that shall be yours and I may.</div><div class='line' id='LC820'>So they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water</div><div class='line' id='LC821'>and broad, and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm</div><div class='line' id='LC822'>clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand.</div><div class='line' id='LC823'>Lo, said Merlin, yonder is that sword that I spake of.  With that</div><div class='line' id='LC824'>they saw a damsel going upon the lake.  What damsel is that?</div><div class='line' id='LC825'>said Arthur.  That is the Lady of the lake, said Merlin; and within</div><div class='line' id='LC826'>that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth,</div><div class='line' id='LC827'>and richly beseen, and this damsel will come to you anon, and then</div><div class='line' id='LC828'>speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.  Anon</div><div class='line' id='LC829'>withal came the damsel unto Arthur and saluted him, and he her</div><div class='line' id='LC830'>again.  Damsel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder</div><div class='line' id='LC831'>the arm holdeth above the water?  I would it were mine, for I have</div><div class='line' id='LC832'>no sword.  Sir Arthur King, said the damsel, that sword is mine,</div><div class='line' id='LC833'>and if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it.</div><div class='line' id='LC834'>By my faith, said Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask.</div><div class='line' id='LC835'>Well, said the damsel, go ye into yonder barge and row yourself</div><div class='line' id='LC836'>to the sword, and take it and the scabbard with you, and I will ask</div><div class='line' id='LC837'>my gift when I see my time.  So Sir Arthur and Merlin alight, and</div><div class='line' id='LC838'>tied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the ship,</div><div class='line' id='LC839'>and when they came to the sword that the hand held, Sir Arthur</div><div class='line' id='LC840'>took it up by the handles, and took it with him.  And the arm</div><div class='line' id='LC841'>and the hand went under the water; and so they came unto the land</div><div class='line' id='LC842'>and rode forth.  And then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion.  What</div><div class='line' id='LC843'>signifieth yonder pavilion?  It is the knight&#39;s pavilion, said</div><div class='line' id='LC844'>Merlin, that ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore, but he is out,</div><div class='line' id='LC845'>he is not there; he hath ado with a knight of yours, that hight</div><div class='line' id='LC846'>Egglame, and they have fought together, but at the last Egglame</div><div class='line' id='LC847'>fled, and else he had been dead, and he hath chased him even</div><div class='line' id='LC848'>to Carlion, and we shall meet with him anon in the highway.  That</div><div class='line' id='LC849'>is well said, said Arthur, now have I a sword, now will I wage</div><div class='line' id='LC850'>battle with him, and be avenged on him.  Sir, ye shall not so,</div><div class='line' id='LC851'>said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so</div><div class='line' id='LC852'>that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also, he will</div><div class='line' id='LC853'>not lightly be matched of one knight living; and therefore it is my</div><div class='line' id='LC854'>counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short</div><div class='line' id='LC855'>time, and his sons, after his days.  Also ye shall see that day</div><div class='line' id='LC856'>in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister</div><div class='line' id='LC857'>to wed.  When I see him, I will do as ye advise me, said Arthur.</div><div class='line' id='LC858'>Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well.</div><div class='line' id='LC859'>Whether liketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard?</div><div class='line' id='LC860'>Me liketh better the sword, said Arthur.  Ye are more unwise,</div><div class='line' id='LC861'>said Merlin, for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword, for while</div><div class='line' id='LC862'>ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood, be ye</div><div class='line' id='LC863'>never so sore wounded; therefore, keep well the scabbard always</div><div class='line' id='LC864'>with you.  So they rode into Carlion, and by the way they met with</div><div class='line' id='LC865'>Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had done such a craft that Pellinore saw</div><div class='line' id='LC866'>not Arthur, and he passed by without any words.  I marvel, said</div><div class='line' id='LC867'>Arthur, that the knight would not speak.  Sir, said Merlin, he saw</div><div class='line' id='LC868'>you not; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed.  So</div><div class='line' id='LC869'>they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights were passing glad.</div><div class='line' id='LC870'>And when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would</div><div class='line' id='LC871'>jeopard his person so alone.  But all men of worship said it was</div><div class='line' id='LC872'>merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in</div><div class='line' id='LC873'>adventure as other poor knights did.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC874'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC875'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC876'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC877'>CHAPTER IV</div><div class='line' id='LC878'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC879'>SIR DINADAN THE HUMORIST</div><div class='line' id='LC880'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC881'>It seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully</div><div class='line' id='LC882'>told; but then I had heard it only once, and that makes a difference;</div><div class='line' id='LC883'>it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh, no doubt.</div><div class='line' id='LC884'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC885'>Sir Dinadan the Humorist was the first to awake, and he soon roused</div><div class='line' id='LC886'>the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality.</div><div class='line' id='LC887'>He tied some metal mugs to a dog&#39;s tail and turned him loose,</div><div class='line' id='LC888'>and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright,</div><div class='line' id='LC889'>with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and</div><div class='line' id='LC890'>crashing against everything that came in their way and making</div><div class='line' id='LC891'>altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and</div><div class='line' id='LC892'>turmoil; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed</div><div class='line' id='LC893'>till the tears flowed, and some fell out of their chairs and</div><div class='line' id='LC894'>wallowed on the floor in ecstasy.  It was just like so many children.</div><div class='line' id='LC895'>Sir Dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep</div><div class='line' id='LC896'>from telling over and over again, to weariness, how the immortal</div><div class='line' id='LC897'>idea happened to occur to him; and as is the way with humorists</div><div class='line' id='LC898'>of his breed, he was still laughing at it after everybody else had</div><div class='line' id='LC899'>got through.  He was so set up that he concluded to make a speech</div><div class='line' id='LC900'>--of course a humorous speech.  I think I never heard so many old</div><div class='line' id='LC901'>played-out jokes strung together in my life.  He was worse than</div><div class='line' id='LC902'>the minstrels, worse than the clown in the circus.  It seemed</div><div class='line' id='LC903'>peculiarly sad to sit here, thirteen hundred years before I was</div><div class='line' id='LC904'>born, and listen again to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that had</div><div class='line' id='LC905'>given me the dry gripes when I was a boy thirteen hundred years</div><div class='line' id='LC906'>afterwards.  It about convinced me that there isn&#39;t any such thing</div><div class='line' id='LC907'>as a new joke possible.  Everybody laughed at these antiquities</div><div class='line' id='LC908'>--but then they always do; I had noticed that, centuries later.</div><div class='line' id='LC909'>However, of course the scoffer didn&#39;t laugh--I mean the boy.  No,</div><div class='line' id='LC910'>he scoffed; there wasn&#39;t anything he wouldn&#39;t scoff at. He said</div><div class='line' id='LC911'>the most of Sir Dinadan&#39;s jokes were rotten and the rest were</div><div class='line' id='LC912'>petrified.  I said &quot;petrified&quot; was good; as I believed, myself,</div><div class='line' id='LC913'>that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of</div><div class='line' id='LC914'>those jokes was by geologic periods.  But that neat idea hit</div><div class='line' id='LC915'>the boy in a blank place, for geology hadn&#39;t been invented yet.</div><div class='line' id='LC916'>However, I made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate</div><div class='line' id='LC917'>the commonwealth up to it if I pulled through.  It is no use</div><div class='line' id='LC918'>to throw a good thing away merely because the market isn&#39;t ripe yet.</div><div class='line' id='LC919'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC920'>Now Sir Kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill with me</div><div class='line' id='LC921'>for fuel.  It was time for me to feel serious, and I did.  Sir Kay</div><div class='line' id='LC922'>told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians, who</div><div class='line' id='LC923'>all wore the same ridiculous garb that I did--a garb that was a work</div><div class='line' id='LC924'>of enchantment, and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt</div><div class='line' id='LC925'>by human hands.  However he had nullified the force of the</div><div class='line' id='LC926'>enchantment by prayer, and had killed my thirteen knights in</div><div class='line' id='LC927'>a three hours&#39; battle, and taken me prisoner, sparing my life</div><div class='line' id='LC928'>in order that so strange a curiosity as I was might be exhibited</div><div class='line' id='LC929'>to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court.  He spoke</div><div class='line' id='LC930'>of me all the time, in the blandest way, as &quot;this prodigious giant,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC931'>and &quot;this horrible sky-towering monster,&quot; and &quot;this tusked and</div><div class='line' id='LC932'>taloned man-devouring ogre&quot;, and everybody took in all this bosh</div><div class='line' id='LC933'>in the naivest way, and never smiled or seemed to notice that</div><div class='line' id='LC934'>there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me.</div><div class='line' id='LC935'>He said that in trying to escape from him I sprang into the top of</div><div class='line' id='LC936'>a tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound, but he dislodged</div><div class='line' id='LC937'>me with a stone the size of a cow, which &quot;all-to brast&quot; the most</div><div class='line' id='LC938'>of my bones, and then swore me to appear at Arthur&#39;s court for</div><div class='line' id='LC939'>sentence.  He ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st;</div><div class='line' id='LC940'>and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before</div><div class='line' id='LC941'>he named the date.</div><div class='line' id='LC942'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC943'>I was in a dismal state by this time; indeed, I was hardly enough</div><div class='line' id='LC944'>in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as</div><div class='line' id='LC945'>to how I had better be killed, the possibility of the killing being</div><div class='line' id='LC946'>doubted by some, because of the enchantment in my clothes. And yet</div><div class='line' id='LC947'>it was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen-dollar slop-shops.</div><div class='line' id='LC948'>Still, I was sane enough to notice this detail, to wit: many of</div><div class='line' id='LC949'>the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great</div><div class='line' id='LC950'>assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would</div><div class='line' id='LC951'>have made a Comanche blush.  Indelicacy is too mild a term to convey</div><div class='line' id='LC952'>the idea.  However, I had read &quot;Tom Jones,&quot; and &quot;Roderick Random,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC953'>and other books of that kind, and knew that the highest and first</div><div class='line' id='LC954'>ladies and gentlemen in England had remained little or no cleaner</div><div class='line' id='LC955'>in their talk, and in the morals and conduct which such talk</div><div class='line' id='LC956'>implies, clear up to a hundred years ago; in fact clear into our</div><div class='line' id='LC957'>own nineteenth century--in which century, broadly speaking,</div><div class='line' id='LC958'>the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable</div><div class='line' id='LC959'>in English history--or in European history, for that matter--may be</div><div class='line' id='LC960'>said to have made their appearance.  Suppose Sir Walter, instead</div><div class='line' id='LC961'>of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters,</div><div class='line' id='LC962'>had allowed the characters to speak for themselves?  We should</div><div class='line' id='LC963'>have had talk from Rebecca and Ivanhoe and the soft lady Rowena</div><div class='line' id='LC964'>which would embarrass a tramp in our day.  However, to the</div><div class='line' id='LC965'>unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate.  King Arthur&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC966'>people were not aware that they were indecent and I had presence</div><div class='line' id='LC967'>of mind enough not to mention it.</div><div class='line' id='LC968'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC969'>They were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were</div><div class='line' id='LC970'>mightily relieved, at last, when old Merlin swept the difficulty</div><div class='line' id='LC971'>away for them with a common-sense hint.  He asked them why they</div><div class='line' id='LC972'>were so dull--why didn&#39;t it occur to them to strip me.  In half a</div><div class='line' id='LC973'>minute I was as naked as a pair of tongs!  And dear, dear, to think</div><div class='line' id='LC974'>of it: I was the only embarrassed person there.  Everybody discussed</div><div class='line' id='LC975'>me; and did it as unconcernedly as if I had been a cabbage.</div><div class='line' id='LC976'>Queen Guenever was as naively interested as the rest, and said</div><div class='line' id='LC977'>she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC978'>the only compliment I got--if it was a compliment.</div><div class='line' id='LC979'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC980'>Finally I was carried off in one direction, and my perilous clothes</div><div class='line' id='LC981'>in another.  I was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon,</div><div class='line' id='LC982'>with some scant remnants for dinner, some moldy straw for a bed,</div><div class='line' id='LC983'>and no end of rats for company.</div><div class='line' id='LC984'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC985'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC986'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC987'>CHAPTER V</div><div class='line' id='LC988'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC989'>AN INSPIRATION</div><div class='line' id='LC990'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC991'>I was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long.</div><div class='line' id='LC992'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC993'>When I next came to myself, I seemed to have been asleep a very</div><div class='line' id='LC994'>long time.  My first thought was, &quot;Well, what an astonishing dream</div><div class='line' id='LC995'>I&#39;ve had!  I reckon I&#39;ve waked only just in time to keep from</div><div class='line' id='LC996'>being hanged or drowned or burned or something....  I&#39;ll nap again</div><div class='line' id='LC997'>till the whistle blows, and then I&#39;ll go down to the arms factory</div><div class='line' id='LC998'>and have it out with Hercules.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC999'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1000'>But just then I heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts,</div><div class='line' id='LC1001'>a light flashed in my eyes, and that butterfly, Clarence, stood</div><div class='line' id='LC1002'>before me!  I gasped with surprise; my breath almost got away from me.</div><div class='line' id='LC1003'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1004'>&quot;What!&quot; I said, &quot;you here yet?  Go along with the rest of</div><div class='line' id='LC1005'>the dream! scatter!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1006'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1007'>But he only laughed, in his light-hearted way, and fell to making</div><div class='line' id='LC1008'>fun of my sorry plight.</div><div class='line' id='LC1009'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1010'>&quot;All right,&quot; I said resignedly, &quot;let the dream go on; I&#39;m in no hurry.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1011'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1012'>&quot;Prithee what dream?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1013'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1014'>&quot;What dream?  Why, the dream that I am in Arthur&#39;s court--a person</div><div class='line' id='LC1015'>who never existed; and that I am talking to you, who are nothing</div><div class='line' id='LC1016'>but a work of the imagination.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1017'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1018'>&quot;Oh, la, indeed! and is it a dream that you&#39;re to be burned</div><div class='line' id='LC1019'>to-morrow?  Ho-ho--answer me that!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1020'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1021'>The shock that went through me was distressing.  I now began</div><div class='line' id='LC1022'>to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious, dream</div><div class='line' id='LC1023'>or no dream; for I knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity</div><div class='line' id='LC1024'>of dreams, that to be burned to death, even in a dream, would be</div><div class='line' id='LC1025'>very far from being a jest, and was a thing to be avoided, by any</div><div class='line' id='LC1026'>means, fair or foul, that I could contrive.  So I said beseechingly:</div><div class='line' id='LC1027'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1028'>&quot;Ah, Clarence, good boy, only friend I&#39;ve got,--for you _are_ my</div><div class='line' id='LC1029'>friend, aren&#39;t you?--don&#39;t fail me; help me to devise some way</div><div class='line' id='LC1030'>of escaping from this place!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1031'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1032'>&quot;Now do but hear thyself!  Escape?  Why, man, the corridors are</div><div class='line' id='LC1033'>in guard and keep of men-at-arms.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1034'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1035'>&quot;No doubt, no doubt.  But how many, Clarence?  Not many, I hope?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1036'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1037'>&quot;Full a score.  One may not hope to escape.&quot;  After a pause</div><div class='line' id='LC1038'>--hesitatingly: &quot;and there be other reasons--and weightier.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1039'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1040'>&quot;Other ones? What are they?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1041'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1042'>&quot;Well, they say--oh, but I daren&#39;t, indeed daren&#39;t!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1043'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1044'>&quot;Why, poor lad, what is the matter?  Why do you blench?  Why do</div><div class='line' id='LC1045'>you tremble so?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1046'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1047'>&quot;Oh, in sooth, there is need!  I do want to tell you, but--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1048'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1049'>&quot;Come, come, be brave, be a man--speak out, there&#39;s a good lad!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1050'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1051'>He hesitated, pulled one way by desire, the other way by fear;</div><div class='line' id='LC1052'>then he stole to the door and peeped out, listening; and finally</div><div class='line' id='LC1053'>crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his</div><div class='line' id='LC1054'>fearful news in a whisper, and with all the cowering apprehension</div><div class='line' id='LC1055'>of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things</div><div class='line' id='LC1056'>whose very mention might be freighted with death.</div><div class='line' id='LC1057'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1058'>&quot;Merlin, in his malice, has woven a spell about this dungeon, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1059'>there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate</div><div class='line' id='LC1060'>enough to essay to cross its lines with you!  Now God pity me,</div><div class='line' id='LC1061'>I have told it!  Ah, be kind to me, be merciful to a poor boy who</div><div class='line' id='LC1062'>means thee well; for an thou betray me I am lost!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1063'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1064'>I laughed the only really refreshing laugh I had had for some time;</div><div class='line' id='LC1065'>and shouted:</div><div class='line' id='LC1066'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1067'>&quot;Merlin has wrought a spell!  _Merlin_, forsooth!  That cheap old</div><div class='line' id='LC1068'>humbug, that maundering old ass?  Bosh, pure bosh, the silliest bosh</div><div class='line' id='LC1069'>in the world!  Why, it does seem to me that of all the childish,</div><div class='line' id='LC1070'>idiotic, chuckle-headed, chicken-livered superstitions that ev</div><div class='line' id='LC1071'>--oh, damn Merlin!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1072'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1073'>But Clarence had slumped to his knees before I had half finished,</div><div class='line' id='LC1074'>and he was like to go out of his mind with fright.</div><div class='line' id='LC1075'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1076'>&quot;Oh, beware!  These are awful words!  Any moment these walls</div><div class='line' id='LC1077'>may crumble upon us if you say such things.  Oh call them back</div><div class='line' id='LC1078'>before it is too late!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1079'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1080'>Now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to</div><div class='line' id='LC1081'>thinking.  If everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely</div><div class='line' id='LC1082'>afraid of Merlin&#39;s pretended magic as Clarence was, certainly</div><div class='line' id='LC1083'>a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive</div><div class='line' id='LC1084'>some way to take advantage of such a state of things.  I went</div><div class='line' id='LC1085'>on thinking, and worked out a plan. Then I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1086'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1087'>&quot;Get up.  Pull yourself together; look me in the eye.  Do you</div><div class='line' id='LC1088'>know why I laughed?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1089'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1090'>&quot;No--but for our blessed Lady&#39;s sake, do it no more.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1091'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1092'>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll tell you why I laughed.  Because I&#39;m a magician myself.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1093'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1094'>&quot;Thou!&quot;  The boy recoiled a step, and caught his breath, for</div><div class='line' id='LC1095'>the thing hit him rather sudden; but the aspect which he took</div><div class='line' id='LC1096'>on was very, very respectful.  I took quick note of that; it</div><div class='line' id='LC1097'>indicated that a humbug didn&#39;t need to have a reputation in this</div><div class='line' id='LC1098'>asylum; people stood ready to take him at his word, without that.</div><div class='line' id='LC1099'>I resumed.</div><div class='line' id='LC1100'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1101'>&quot;I&#39;ve known Merlin seven hundred years, and he--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1102'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1103'>&quot;Seven hun--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1104'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1105'>&quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me.  He has died and come alive again thirteen</div><div class='line' id='LC1106'>times, and traveled under a new name every time: Smith, Jones,</div><div class='line' id='LC1107'>Robinson, Jackson, Peters, Haskins, Merlin--a new alias every</div><div class='line' id='LC1108'>time he turns up.  I knew him in Egypt three hundred years ago;</div><div class='line' id='LC1109'>I knew him in India five hundred years ago--he is always blethering</div><div class='line' id='LC1110'>around in my way, everywhere I go; he makes me tired.  He don&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC1111'>amount to shucks, as a magician; knows some of the old common</div><div class='line' id='LC1112'>tricks, but has never got beyond the rudiments, and never will.</div><div class='line' id='LC1113'>He is well enough for the provinces--one-night stands and that</div><div class='line' id='LC1114'>sort of thing, you know--but dear me, _he_ oughtn&#39;t to set up for</div><div class='line' id='LC1115'>an expert--anyway not where there&#39;s a real artist.  Now look here,</div><div class='line' id='LC1116'>Clarence, I am going to stand your friend, right along, and in</div><div class='line' id='LC1117'>return you must be mine.  I want you to do me a favor.

Will you get that to the king for me?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1124'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1125'>The poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me.</div><div class='line' id='LC1126'>It was pitiful to see a creature so terrified, so unnerved, so</div><div class='line' id='LC1127'>demoralized.  But he promised everything; and on my side he made</div><div class='line' id='LC1128'>me promise over and over again that I would remain his friend, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1129'>never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him. Then</div><div class='line' id='LC1130'>he worked his way out, staying himself with his hand along the</div><div class='line' id='LC1131'>wall, like a sick person.</div><div class='line' id='LC1132'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1133'>Presently this thought occurred to me: how heedless I have been!</div><div class='line' id='LC1134'>When the boy gets calm, he will wonder why a great magician like me</div><div class='line' id='LC1135'>should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place;</div><div class='line' id='LC1136'>he will put this and that together, and will see that I am a humbug.</div><div class='line' id='LC1137'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1138'>I worried over that heedless blunder for an hour, and called myself</div><div class='line' id='LC1139'>a great many hard names, meantime.

I was at rest, then.</div><div class='line' id='LC1143'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1144'>But as soon as one is at rest, in this world, off he goes on</div><div class='line' id='LC1145'>something else to worry about.  It occurred to me that I had made</div><div class='line' id='LC1146'>another blunder: I had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with</div><div class='line' id='LC1147'>a threat--I intending to invent a calamity at my leisure; now</div><div class='line' id='LC1148'>the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to</div><div class='line' id='LC1149'>swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you</div><div class='line' id='LC1150'>perform them; suppose I should be called on for a sample?  Suppose</div><div class='line' id='LC1151'>I should be asked to name my calamity?  Yes, I had made a blunder;</div><div class='line' id='LC1152'>I ought to have invented my calamity first.  &quot;What shall I do?</div><div class='line' id='LC1153'>what can I say, to gain a little time?&quot;  I was in trouble again;</div><div class='line' id='LC1154'>in the deepest kind of trouble...</div><div class='line' id='LC1155'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1156'>&quot;There&#39;s a footstep!--they&#39;re coming.

They</div><div class='line' id='LC1175'>disputed long, but in the end, Merlin, scoffing, said, &#39;Wherefore</div><div class='line' id='LC1176'>hath he not _named_ his brave calamity?  Verily it is because he</div><div class='line' id='LC1177'>cannot.&#39;  This thrust did in a most sudden sort close the king&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC1178'>mouth, and he could offer naught to turn the argument; and so,</div><div class='line' id='LC1179'>reluctant, and full loth to do you the discourtesy, he yet prayeth</div><div class='line' id='LC1180'>you to consider his perplexed case, as noting how the matter stands,</div><div class='line' id='LC1181'>and name the calamity--if so be you have determined the nature</div><div class='line' id='LC1182'>of it and the time of its coming.  Oh, prithee delay not; to delay</div><div class='line' id='LC1183'>at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already</div><div class='line' id='LC1184'>compass thee about.  Oh, be thou wise--name the calamity!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1185'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1186'>I allowed silence to accumulate while I got my impressiveness</div><div class='line' id='LC1187'>together, and then said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1188'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1189'>&quot;How long have I been shut up in this hole?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1190'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1191'>&quot;Ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent.

Nine in the morning</div><div class='line' id='LC1195'>now!  And yet it is the very complexion of midnight, to a shade.</div><div class='line' id='LC1196'>This is the 20th, then?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1197'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1198'>&quot;The 20th--yes.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1199'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1200'>&quot;And I am to be burned alive to-morrow.&quot;  The boy shuddered.</div><div class='line' id='LC1201'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1202'>&quot;At what hour?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1203'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1204'>&quot;At high noon.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1205'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1206'>&quot;Now then, I will tell you what to say.&quot;  I paused, and stood over</div><div class='line' id='LC1207'>that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence; then, in a voice</div><div class='line' id='LC1208'>deep, measured, charged with doom, I began, and rose by dramatically</div><div class='line' id='LC1209'>graded stages to my colossal climax, which I delivered in as sublime</div><div class='line' id='LC1210'>and noble a way as ever I did such a thing in my life: &quot;Go back</div><div class='line' id='LC1211'>and tell the king that at that hour I will smother the whole world</div><div class='line' id='LC1212'>in the dead blackness of midnight; I will blot out the sun, and he</div><div class='line' id='LC1213'>shall never shine again; the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack</div><div class='line' id='LC1214'>of light and warmth, and the peoples of the earth shall famish</div><div class='line' id='LC1215'>and die, to the last man!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1216'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1217'>I had to carry the boy out myself, he sunk into such a collapse.</div><div class='line' id='LC1218'>I handed him over to the soldiers, and went back.</div><div class='line' id='LC1219'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1220'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1221'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1222'>CHAPTER VI</div><div class='line' id='LC1223'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1224'>THE ECLIPSE</div><div class='line' id='LC1225'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1226'>In the stillness and the darkness, realization soon began to</div><div class='line' id='LC1227'>supplement knowledge.  The mere knowledge of a fact is pale; but</div><div class='line' id='LC1228'>when you come to _realize_ your fact, it takes on color. It is</div><div class='line' id='LC1229'>all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to</div><div class='line' id='LC1230'>the heart, and seeing it done.  In the stillness and the darkness,</div><div class='line' id='LC1231'>the knowledge that I was in deadly danger took to itself deeper</div><div class='line' id='LC1232'>and deeper meaning all the time; a something which was realization</div><div class='line' id='LC1233'>crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold.</div><div class='line' id='LC1234'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1235'>But it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these,</div><div class='line' id='LC1236'>as soon as a man&#39;s mercury has got down to a certain point there</div><div class='line' id='LC1237'>comes a revulsion, and he rallies.  Hope springs up, and cheerfulness</div><div class='line' id='LC1238'>along with it, and then he is in good shape to do something for</div><div class='line' id='LC1239'>himself, if anything can be done.  When my rally came, it came with</div><div class='line' id='LC1240'>a bound.  I said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me,</div><div class='line' id='LC1241'>and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides; and straightway</div><div class='line' id='LC1242'>my mercury went up to the top of the tube, and my solicitudes</div><div class='line' id='LC1243'>all vanished.  I was as happy a man as there was in the world.</div><div class='line' id='LC1244'>I was even impatient for to-morrow to come, I so wanted to gather</div><div class='line' id='LC1245'>in that great triumph and be the center of all the nation&#39;s wonder</div><div class='line' id='LC1246'>and reverence.  Besides, in a business way it would be the making</div><div class='line' id='LC1247'>of me; I knew that.</div><div class='line' id='LC1248'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1249'>Meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background</div><div class='line' id='LC1250'>of my mind.  That was the half-conviction that when the nature</div><div class='line' id='LC1251'>of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious</div><div class='line' id='LC1252'>people, it would have such an effect that they would want to</div><div class='line' id='LC1253'>compromise.  So, by and by when I heard footsteps coming, that</div><div class='line' id='LC1254'>thought was recalled to me, and I said to myself, &quot;As sure as</div><div class='line' id='LC1255'>anything, it&#39;s the compromise.  Well, if it is good, all right,</div><div class='line' id='LC1256'>I will accept; but if it isn&#39;t, I mean to stand my ground and play</div><div class='line' id='LC1257'>my hand for all it is worth.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1258'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1259'>The door opened, and some men-at-arms appeared.  The leader said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1260'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1261'>&quot;The stake is ready. Come!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1262'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1263'>The stake!  The strength went out of me, and I almost fell down.</div><div class='line' id='LC1264'>It is hard to get one&#39;s breath at such a time, such lumps come into</div><div class='line' id='LC1265'>one&#39;s throat, and such gaspings; but as soon as I could speak, I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1266'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1267'>&quot;But this is a mistake--the execution is to-morrow.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1268'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1269'>&quot;Order changed; been set forward a day.  Haste thee!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1270'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1271'>I was lost.  There was no help for me.  I was dazed, stupefied;</div><div class='line' id='LC1272'>I had no command over myself, I only wandered purposely about,</div><div class='line' id='LC1273'>like one out of his mind; so the soldiers took hold of me, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1274'>pulled me along with them, out of the cell and along the maze of</div><div class='line' id='LC1275'>underground corridors, and finally into the fierce glare of daylight</div><div class='line' id='LC1276'>and the upper world.  As we stepped into the vast enclosed court</div><div class='line' id='LC1277'>of the castle I got a shock; for the first thing I saw was the stake,</div><div class='line' id='LC1278'>standing in the center, and near it the piled fagots and a monk.</div><div class='line' id='LC1279'>On all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank</div><div class='line' id='LC1280'>above rank, forming sloping terraces that were rich with color.</div><div class='line' id='LC1281'>The king and the queen sat in their thrones, the most conspicuous</div><div class='line' id='LC1282'>figures there, of course.</div><div class='line' id='LC1283'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1284'>To note all this, occupied but a second.  The next second Clarence</div><div class='line' id='LC1285'>had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news</div><div class='line' id='LC1286'>into my ear, his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness.  He said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1287'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1288'>&quot;Tis through _me_ the change was wrought!  And main hard have I worked</div><div class='line' id='LC1289'>to do it, too.  But when I revealed to them the calamity in store,</div><div class='line' id='LC1290'>and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender, then saw I also</div><div class='line' id='LC1291'>that this was the time to strike!  Wherefore I diligently pretended,</div><div class='line' id='LC1292'>unto this and that and the other one, that your power against the sun</div><div class='line' id='LC1293'>could not reach its full until the morrow; and so if any would save</div><div class='line' id='LC1294'>the sun and the world, you must be slain to-day, while your</div><div class='line' id='LC1295'>enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency.  Odsbodikins,</div><div class='line' id='LC1296'>it was but a dull lie, a most indifferent invention, but you should</div><div class='line' id='LC1297'>have seen them seize it and swallow it, in the frenzy of their</div><div class='line' id='LC1298'>fright, as it were salvation sent from heaven; and all the while</div><div class='line' id='LC1299'>was I laughing in my sleeve the one moment, to see them so cheaply</div><div class='line' id='LC1300'>deceived, and glorifying God the next, that He was content to let</div><div class='line' id='LC1301'>the meanest of His creatures be His instrument to the saving of</div><div class='line' id='LC1302'>thy life.  Ah how happy has the matter sped!  You will not need</div><div class='line' id='LC1303'>to do the sun a _real_ hurt--ah, forget not that, on your soul forget</div><div class='line' id='LC1304'>it not!  Only make a little darkness--only the littlest little</div><div class='line' id='LC1305'>darkness, mind, and cease with that.  It will be sufficient.  They</div><div class='line' id='LC1306'>will see that I spoke falsely,--being ignorant, as they will fancy</div><div class='line' id='LC1307'>--and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you</div><div class='line' id='LC1308'>shall see them go mad with fear; and they will set you free and</div><div class='line' id='LC1309'>make you great!  Go to thy triumph, now!  But remember--ah, good</div><div class='line' id='LC1310'>friend, I implore thee remember my supplication, and do the blessed</div><div class='line' id='LC1311'>sun no hurt.  For _my_ sake, thy true friend.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1312'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1313'>I choked out some words through my grief and misery; as much as</div><div class='line' id='LC1314'>to say I would spare the sun; for which the lad&#39;s eyes paid me back</div><div class='line' id='LC1315'>with such deep and loving gratitude that I had not the heart</div><div class='line' id='LC1316'>to tell him his good-hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me</div><div class='line' id='LC1317'>to my death.</div><div class='line' id='LC1318'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1319'>As the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was</div><div class='line' id='LC1320'>so profound that if I had been blindfold I should have supposed</div><div class='line' id='LC1321'>I was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people.</div><div class='line' id='LC1322'>There was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity;</div><div class='line' id='LC1323'>they were as rigid as stone images, and as pale; and dread sat</div><div class='line' id='LC1324'>upon every countenance.  This hush continued while I was being</div><div class='line' id='LC1325'>chained to the stake; it still continued while the fagots were</div><div class='line' id='LC1326'>carefully and tediously piled about my ankles, my knees, my thighs,</div><div class='line' id='LC1327'>my body.  Then there was a pause, and a deeper hush, if possible,</div><div class='line' id='LC1328'>and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch; the multitude</div><div class='line' id='LC1329'>strained forward, gazing, and parting slightly from their seats</div><div class='line' id='LC1330'>without knowing it; the monk raised his hands above my head, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1331'>his eyes toward the blue sky, and began some words in Latin; in</div><div class='line' id='LC1332'>this attitude he droned on and on, a little while, and then stopped.</div><div class='line' id='LC1333'>I waited two or three moments; then looked up; he was standing</div><div class='line' id='LC1334'>there petrified.  With a common impulse the multitude rose slowly</div><div class='line' id='LC1335'>up and stared into the sky.  I followed their eyes, as sure as guns,</div><div class='line' id='LC1336'>there was my eclipse beginning!  The life went boiling through</div><div class='line' id='LC1337'>my veins; I was a new man!  The rim of black spread slowly into</div><div class='line' id='LC1338'>the sun&#39;s disk, my heart beat higher and higher, and still the</div><div class='line' id='LC1339'>assemblage and the priest stared into the sky, motionless.  I knew</div><div class='line' id='LC1340'>that this gaze would be turned upon me, next.  When it was, I was</div><div class='line' id='LC1341'>ready.  I was in one of the most grand attitudes I ever struck,</div><div class='line' id='LC1342'>with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun.  It was a noble</div><div class='line' id='LC1343'>effect.  You could _see_ the shudder sweep the mass like a wave.</div><div class='line' id='LC1344'>Two shouts rang out, one close upon the heels of the other:</div><div class='line' id='LC1345'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1346'>&quot;Apply the torch!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1347'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1348'>&quot;I forbid it!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1349'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1350'>The one was from Merlin, the other from the king.  Merlin started</div><div class='line' id='LC1351'>from his place--to apply the torch himself, I judged.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1352'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1353'>&quot;Stay where you are.  If any man moves--even the king--before</div><div class='line' id='LC1354'>I give him leave, I will blast him with thunder, I will consume</div><div class='line' id='LC1355'>him with lightnings!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1356'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1357'>The multitude sank meekly into their seats, and I was just expecting</div><div class='line' id='LC1358'>they would.  Merlin hesitated a moment or two, and I was on pins</div><div class='line' id='LC1359'>and needles during that little while.  Then he sat down, and I took</div><div class='line' id='LC1360'>a good breath; for I knew I was master of the situation now.</div><div class='line' id='LC1361'>The king said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1362'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1363'>&quot;Be merciful, fair sir, and essay no further in this perilous matter,</div><div class='line' id='LC1364'>lest disaster follow.  It was reported to us that your powers could</div><div class='line' id='LC1365'>not attain unto their full strength until the morrow; but--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1366'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1367'>&quot;Your Majesty thinks the report may have been a lie?  It _was_ a lie.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1368'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1369'>That made an immense effect; up went appealing hands everywhere,</div><div class='line' id='LC1370'>and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that</div><div class='line' id='LC1371'>I might be bought off at any price, and the calamity stayed.</div><div class='line' id='LC1372'>The king was eager to comply. He said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1373'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1374'>&quot;Name any terms, reverend sir, even to the halving of my kingdom;</div><div class='line' id='LC1375'>but banish this calamity, spare the sun!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1376'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1377'>My fortune was made.  I would have taken him up in a minute, but</div><div class='line' id='LC1378'>I couldn&#39;t stop an eclipse; the thing was out of the question.  So</div><div class='line' id='LC1379'>I asked time to consider.  The king said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1380'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1381'>&quot;How long--ah, how long, good sir?  Be merciful; look, it groweth</div><div class='line' id='LC1382'>darker, moment by moment.  Prithee how long?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1383'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1384'>&quot;Not long.  Half an hour--maybe an hour.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1385'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1386'>There were a thousand pathetic protests, but I couldn&#39;t shorten up</div><div class='line' id='LC1387'>any, for I couldn&#39;t remember how long a total eclipse lasts.  I was</div><div class='line' id='LC1388'>in a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think.  Something</div><div class='line' id='LC1389'>was wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling.</div><div class='line' id='LC1390'>If this wasn&#39;t the one I was after, how was I to tell whether this</div><div class='line' id='LC1391'>was the sixth century, or nothing but a dream?  Dear me, if I could</div><div class='line' id='LC1392'>only prove it was the latter!  Here was a glad new hope.  If the boy</div><div class='line' id='LC1393'>was right about the date, and this was surely the 20th, it _wasn&#39;t_</div><div class='line' id='LC1394'>the sixth century.  I reached for the monk&#39;s sleeve, in considerable</div><div class='line' id='LC1395'>excitement, and asked him what day of the month it was.</div><div class='line' id='LC1396'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1397'>Hang him, he said it was the _twenty-first_!  It made me turn cold</div><div class='line' id='LC1398'>to hear him.  I begged him not to make any mistake about it; but</div><div class='line' id='LC1399'>he was sure; he knew it was the 21st.  So, that feather-headed</div><div class='line' id='LC1400'>boy had botched things again!  The time of the day was right</div><div class='line' id='LC1401'>for the eclipse; I had seen that for myself, in the beginning,</div><div class='line' id='LC1402'>by the dial that was near by.  Yes, I was in King Arthur&#39;s court,</div><div class='line' id='LC1403'>and I might as well make the most out of it I could.</div><div class='line' id='LC1404'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1405'>The darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more and</div><div class='line' id='LC1406'>more distressed.  I now said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1407'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1408'>&quot;I have reflected, Sir King.  For a lesson, I will let this darkness</div><div class='line' id='LC1409'>proceed, and spread night in the world; but whether I blot out</div><div class='line' id='LC1410'>the sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you.  These are</div><div class='line' id='LC1411'>the terms, to wit: You shall remain king over all your dominions,</div><div class='line' id='LC1412'>and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship;</div><div class='line' id='LC1413'>but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive,</div><div class='line' id='LC1414'>and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase</div><div class='line' id='LC1415'>of revenue over and above its present amount as I may succeed</div><div class='line' id='LC1416'>in creating for the state.  If I can&#39;t live on that, I sha&#39;n&#39;t ask</div><div class='line' id='LC1417'>anybody to give me a lift.  Is it satisfactory?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1418'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1419'>There was a prodigious roar of applause, and out of the midst</div><div class='line' id='LC1420'>of it the king&#39;s voice rose, saying:</div><div class='line' id='LC1421'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1422'>&quot;Away with his bonds, and set him free! and do him homage, high</div><div class='line' id='LC1423'>and low, rich and poor, for he is become the king&#39;s right hand,</div><div class='line' id='LC1424'>is clothed with power and authority, and his seat is upon the highest</div><div class='line' id='LC1425'>step of the throne!  Now sweep away this creeping night, and bring</div><div class='line' id='LC1426'>the light and cheer again, that all the world may bless thee.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1427'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1428'>But I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1429'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1430'>&quot;That a common man should be shamed before the world, is nothing;</div><div class='line' id='LC1431'>but it were dishonor to the _king_ if any that saw his minister naked</div><div class='line' id='LC1432'>should not also see him delivered from his shame.  If I might ask</div><div class='line' id='LC1433'>that my clothes be brought again--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1434'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1435'>&quot;They are not meet,&quot; the king broke in.  &quot;Fetch raiment of another</div><div class='line' id='LC1436'>sort; clothe him like a prince!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1437'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1438'>My idea worked.  I wanted to keep things as they were till the</div><div class='line' id='LC1439'>eclipse was total, otherwise they would be trying again to get</div><div class='line' id='LC1440'>me to dismiss the darkness, and of course I couldn&#39;t do it.  Sending</div><div class='line' id='LC1441'>for the clothes gained some delay, but not enough.  So I had to make</div><div class='line' id='LC1442'>another excuse.  I said it would be but natural if the king should</div><div class='line' id='LC1443'>change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done</div><div class='line' id='LC1444'>under excitement; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while,</div><div class='line' id='LC1445'>and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind</div><div class='line' id='LC1446'>the same, the darkness should be dismissed.  Neither the king nor</div><div class='line' id='LC1447'>anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement, but I had</div><div class='line' id='LC1448'>to stick to my point.</div><div class='line' id='LC1449'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1450'>It grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker, while I struggled</div><div class='line' id='LC1451'>with those awkward sixth-century clothes.  It got to be pitch dark,</div><div class='line' id='LC1452'>at last, and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold</div><div class='line' id='LC1453'>uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars</div><div class='line' id='LC1454'>come out and twinkle in the sky.  At last the eclipse was total,</div><div class='line' id='LC1455'>and I was very glad of it, but everybody else was in misery; which</div><div class='line' id='LC1456'>was quite natural. I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1457'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1458'>&quot;The king, by his silence, still stands to the terms.&quot;  Then</div><div class='line' id='LC1459'>I lifted up my hands--stood just so a moment--then I said, with</div><div class='line' id='LC1460'>the most awful solemnity: &quot;Let the enchantment dissolve and</div><div class='line' id='LC1461'>pass harmless away!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1462'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1463'>There was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and</div><div class='line' id='LC1464'>that graveyard hush.  But when the silver rim of the sun pushed</div><div class='line' id='LC1465'>itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with</div><div class='line' id='LC1466'>a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me</div><div class='line' id='LC1467'>with blessings and gratitude; and Clarence was not the last of</div><div class='line' id='LC1468'>the wash, to be sure.</div><div class='line' id='LC1469'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1470'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1471'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1472'>CHAPTER VII</div><div class='line' id='LC1473'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1474'>MERLIN&#39;S TOWER</div><div class='line' id='LC1475'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1476'>Inasmuch as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom, as far</div><div class='line' id='LC1477'>as political power and authority were concerned, much was made</div><div class='line' id='LC1478'>of me.  My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold,</div><div class='line' id='LC1479'>and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.  But habit</div><div class='line' id='LC1480'>would soon reconcile me to my clothes; I was aware of that.  I was</div><div class='line' id='LC1481'>given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after</div><div class='line' id='LC1482'>the king&#39;s.  They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings,</div><div class='line' id='LC1483'>but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet,</div><div class='line' id='LC1484'>and they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed.</div><div class='line' id='LC1485'>As for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren&#39;t any.  I mean</div><div class='line' id='LC1486'>_little_ conveniences; it is the little conveniences that make</div><div class='line' id='LC1487'>the real comfort of life.  The big oaken chairs, graced with rude</div><div class='line' id='LC1488'>carvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place.</div><div class='line' id='LC1489'>There was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass--except a metal</div><div class='line' id='LC1490'>one, about as powerful as a pail of water.  And not a chromo.</div><div class='line' id='LC1491'>I had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without</div><div class='line' id='LC1492'>my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric</div><div class='line' id='LC1493'>of my being, and was become a part of me.  It made me homesick</div><div class='line' id='LC1494'>to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness</div><div class='line' id='LC1495'>and remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending</div><div class='line' id='LC1496'>as it was, you couldn&#39;t go into a room but you would find an</div><div class='line' id='LC1497'>insurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home</div><div class='line' id='LC1498'>over the door; and in the parlor we had nine.  But here, even in</div><div class='line' id='LC1499'>my grand room of state, there wasn&#39;t anything in the nature of</div><div class='line' id='LC1500'>a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either</div><div class='line' id='LC1501'>woven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it</div><div class='line' id='LC1502'>was the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions,</div><div class='line' id='LC1503'>even Raphael himself couldn&#39;t have botched them more formidably,</div><div class='line' id='LC1504'>after all his practice on those nightmares they call his &quot;celebrated</div><div class='line' id='LC1505'>Hampton Court cartoons.&quot;  Raphael was a bird.  We had several</div><div class='line' id='LC1506'>of his chromos; one was his &quot;Miraculous Draught of Fishes,&quot; where</div><div class='line' id='LC1507'>he puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men into a canoe which</div><div class='line' id='LC1508'>wouldn&#39;t have held a dog without upsetting.  I always admired</div><div class='line' id='LC1509'>to study R.&#39;s art, it was so fresh and unconventional.</div><div class='line' id='LC1510'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1511'>There wasn&#39;t even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle.  I had</div><div class='line' id='LC1512'>a great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the</div><div class='line' id='LC1513'>anteroom; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him.</div><div class='line' id='LC1514'>There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full</div><div class='line' id='LC1515'>of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was</div><div class='line' id='LC1516'>the thing that produced what was regarded as light.  A lot of</div><div class='line' id='LC1517'>these hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it</div><div class='line' id='LC1518'>down enough to make it dismal.  If you went out at night, your</div><div class='line' id='LC1519'>servants carried torches.  There were no books, pens, paper or</div><div class='line' id='LC1520'>ink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows.</div><div class='line' id='LC1521'>It is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomes</div><div class='line' id='LC1522'>a big thing.  But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC1523'>any sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco.  I saw that I was just another</div><div class='line' id='LC1524'>Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society</div><div class='line' id='LC1525'>but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life</div><div class='line' id='LC1526'>bearable I must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganize</div><div class='line' id='LC1527'>things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy.  Well,</div><div class='line' id='LC1528'>that was in my line.</div><div class='line' id='LC1529'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1530'>One thing troubled me along at first--the immense interest which</div><div class='line' id='LC1531'>people took in me.  Apparently the whole nation wanted a look</div><div class='line' id='LC1532'>at me.  It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British</div><div class='line' id='LC1533'>world almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country,</div><div class='line' id='LC1534'>from one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1535'>the churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying</div><div class='line' id='LC1536'>and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was</div><div class='line' id='LC1537'>come.  Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful</div><div class='line' id='LC1538'>event was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur&#39;s court; that he</div><div class='line' id='LC1539'>could have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just going</div><div class='line' id='LC1540'>to do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved</div><div class='line' id='LC1541'>his enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man</div><div class='line' id='LC1542'>who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and</div><div class='line' id='LC1543'>its peoples from extinction.  Now if you consider that everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC1544'>believed that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed</div><div class='line' id='LC1545'>of doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not</div><div class='line' id='LC1546'>a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles</div><div class='line' id='LC1547'>to get a sight of me.  Of course I was all the talk--all other</div><div class='line' id='LC1548'>subjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of</div><div class='line' id='LC1549'>minor interest and notoriety.  Within twenty-four hours the</div><div class='line' id='LC1550'>delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight</div><div class='line' id='LC1551'>they kept coming.  The village was crowded, and all the countryside.</div><div class='line' id='LC1552'>I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these</div><div class='line' id='LC1553'>reverent and awe-stricken multitudes.  It came to be a great burden,</div><div class='line' id='LC1554'>as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time</div><div class='line' id='LC1555'>compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center</div><div class='line' id='LC1556'>of homage.  It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which</div><div class='line' id='LC1557'>was a great satisfaction to me.  But there was one thing I couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC1558'>understand--nobody had asked for an autograph.  I spoke to Clarence</div><div class='line' id='LC1559'>about it.  By George!  I had to explain to him what it was.  Then</div><div class='line' id='LC1560'>he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen</div><div class='line' id='LC1561'>priests.  Land! think of that.</div><div class='line' id='LC1562'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1563'>There was another thing that troubled me a little.  Those multitudes</div><div class='line' id='LC1564'>presently began to agitate for another miracle.  That was natural.</div><div class='line' id='LC1565'>To be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they</div><div class='line' id='LC1566'>had seen the man who could command the sun, riding in the heavens,</div><div class='line' id='LC1567'>and be obeyed, would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors,</div><div class='line' id='LC1568'>and envied by them all; but to be able to also say they had seen</div><div class='line' id='LC1569'>him work a miracle themselves--why, people would come a distance</div><div class='line' id='LC1570'>to see _them_.  The pressure got to be pretty strong.  There was</div><div class='line' id='LC1571'>going to be an eclipse of the moon, and I knew the date and hour,</div><div class='line' id='LC1572'>but it was too far away.  Two years.  I would have given a good</div><div class='line' id='LC1573'>deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was</div><div class='line' id='LC1574'>a big market for it.  It seemed a great pity to have it wasted so,</div><div class='line' id='LC1575'>and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn&#39;t have any</div><div class='line' id='LC1576'>use for it, as like as not.  If it had been booked for only a month</div><div class='line' id='LC1577'>away, I could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, I couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC1578'>seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so I gave up</div><div class='line' id='LC1579'>trying.  Next, Clarence found that old Merlin was making himself</div><div class='line' id='LC1580'>busy on the sly among those people.  He was spreading a report that</div><div class='line' id='LC1581'>I was a humbug, and that the reason I didn&#39;t accommodate the people</div><div class='line' id='LC1582'>with a miracle was because I couldn&#39;t.  I saw that I must do</div><div class='line' id='LC1583'>something.  I presently thought out a plan.</div><div class='line' id='LC1584'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1585'>By my authority as executive I threw Merlin into prison--the same</div><div class='line' id='LC1586'>cell I had occupied myself.  Then I gave public notice by herald</div><div class='line' id='LC1587'>and trumpet that I should be busy with affairs of state for</div><div class='line' id='LC1588'>a fortnight, but about the end of that time I would take a moment&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC1589'>leisure and blow up Merlin&#39;s stone tower by fires from heaven;</div><div class='line' id='LC1590'>in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him</div><div class='line' id='LC1591'>beware.  Furthermore, I would perform but this one miracle at</div><div class='line' id='LC1592'>this time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured,</div><div class='line' id='LC1593'>I would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.</div><div class='line' id='LC1594'>Quiet ensued.</div><div class='line' id='LC1595'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1596'>I took Clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we</div><div class='line' id='LC1597'>went to work privately.  I told him that this was a sort of miracle</div><div class='line' id='LC1598'>that required a trifle of preparation, and that it would be sudden</div><div class='line' id='LC1599'>death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody.  That made</div><div class='line' id='LC1600'>his mouth safe enough.  Clandestinely we made a few bushels of</div><div class='line' id='LC1601'>first-rate blasting powder, and I superintended my armorers while</div><div class='line' id='LC1602'>they constructed a lightning-rod and some wires.  This old stone</div><div class='line' id='LC1603'>tower was very massive--and rather ruinous, too, for it was Roman,</div><div class='line' id='LC1604'>and four hundred years old.  Yes, and handsome, after a rude</div><div class='line' id='LC1605'>fashion, and clothed with ivy from base to summit, as with a shirt</div><div class='line' id='LC1606'>of scale mail.  It stood on a lonely eminence, in good view from</div><div class='line' id='LC1607'>the castle, and about half a mile away.</div><div class='line' id='LC1608'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1609'>Working by night, we stowed the powder in the tower--dug stones</div><div class='line' id='LC1610'>out, on the inside, and buried the powder in the walls themselves,</div><div class='line' id='LC1611'>which were fifteen feet thick at the base.  We put in a peck</div><div class='line' id='LC1612'>at a time, in a dozen places.  We could have blown up the Tower</div><div class='line' id='LC1613'>of London with these charges.  When the thirteenth night was come</div><div class='line' id='LC1614'>we put up our lightning-rod, bedded it in one of the batches of</div><div class='line' id='LC1615'>powder, and ran wires from it to the other batches.  Everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC1616'>had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation, but</div><div class='line' id='LC1617'>on the morning of the fourteenth I thought best to warn the people,</div><div class='line' id='LC1618'>through the heralds, to keep clear away--a quarter of a mile away.</div><div class='line' id='LC1619'>Then added, by command, that at some time during the twenty-four</div><div class='line' id='LC1620'>hours I would consummate the miracle, but would first give a brief</div><div class='line' id='LC1621'>notice; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime, by</div><div class='line' id='LC1622'>torch-baskets in the same places if at night.</div><div class='line' id='LC1623'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1624'>Thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late, and I was</div><div class='line' id='LC1625'>not much afraid of a failure; still, I shouldn&#39;t have cared for</div><div class='line' id='LC1626'>a delay of a day or two; I should have explained that I was busy</div><div class='line' id='LC1627'>with affairs of state yet, and the people must wait.</div><div class='line' id='LC1628'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1629'>Of course, we had a blazing sunny day--almost the first one without</div><div class='line' id='LC1630'>a cloud for three weeks; things always happen so.  I kept secluded,</div><div class='line' id='LC1631'>and watched the weather.  Clarence dropped in from time to time</div><div class='line' id='LC1632'>and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the</div><div class='line' id='LC1633'>time, and the whole country filling up with human masses as far</div><div class='line' id='LC1634'>as one could see from the battlements.  At last the wind sprang up</div><div class='line' id='LC1635'>and a cloud appeared--in the right quarter, too, and just at</div><div class='line' id='LC1636'>nightfall.  For a little while I watched that distant cloud spread</div><div class='line' id='LC1637'>and blacken, then I judged it was time for me to appear.  I ordered</div><div class='line' id='LC1638'>the torch-baskets to be lit, and Merlin liberated and sent to me.</div><div class='line' id='LC1639'>A quarter of an hour later I ascended the parapet and there found</div><div class='line' id='LC1640'>the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness</div><div class='line' id='LC1641'>toward Merlin&#39;s Tower.  Already the darkness was so heavy that</div><div class='line' id='LC1642'>one could not see far; these people and the old turrets, being</div><div class='line' id='LC1643'>partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great</div><div class='line' id='LC1644'>torch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a picture.</div><div class='line' id='LC1645'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1646'>Merlin arrived in a gloomy mood.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1647'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1648'>&quot;You wanted to burn me alive when I had not done you any harm,</div><div class='line' id='LC1649'>and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional</div><div class='line' id='LC1650'>reputation.  Therefore I am going to call down fire and blow up</div><div class='line' id='LC1651'>your tower, but it is only fair to give you a chance; now if you</div><div class='line' id='LC1652'>think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires, step</div><div class='line' id='LC1653'>to the bat, it&#39;s your innings.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1654'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1655'>&quot;I can, fair sir, and I will. Doubt it not.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1656'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1657'>He drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof, and burnt</div><div class='line' id='LC1658'>a pinch of powder in it, which sent up a small cloud of aromatic</div><div class='line' id='LC1659'>smoke, whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves</div><div class='line' id='LC1660'>and get uncomfortable.  Then he began to mutter and make passes</div><div class='line' id='LC1661'>in the air with his hands.  He worked himself up slowly and</div><div class='line' id='LC1662'>gradually into a sort of frenzy, and got to thrashing around with</div><div class='line' id='LC1663'>his arms like the sails of a windmill.  By this time the storm had</div><div class='line' id='LC1664'>about reached us; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and</div><div class='line' id='LC1665'>making the shadows swash about, the first heavy drops of rain</div><div class='line' id='LC1666'>were falling, the world abroad was black as pitch, the lightning</div><div class='line' id='LC1667'>began to wink fitfully.  Of course, my rod would be loading itself</div><div class='line' id='LC1668'>now.  In fact, things were imminent. So I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC1669'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1670'>&quot;You have had time enough.  I have given you every advantage,</div><div class='line' id='LC1671'>and not interfered.  It is plain your magic is weak. It is only</div><div class='line' id='LC1672'>fair that I begin now.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1673'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1674'>I made about three passes in the air, and then there was an awful</div><div class='line' id='LC1675'>crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks, along</div><div class='line' id='LC1676'>with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday,</div><div class='line' id='LC1677'>and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground</div><div class='line' id='LC1678'>in a general collapse of consternation.  Well, it rained mortar and</div><div class='line' id='LC1679'>masonry the rest of the week.  This was the report; but probably</div><div class='line' id='LC1680'>the facts would have modified it.</div><div class='line' id='LC1681'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1682'>It was an effective miracle.  The great bothersome temporary</div><div class='line' id='LC1683'>population vanished.  There were a good many thousand tracks</div><div class='line' id='LC1684'>in the mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound.</div><div class='line' id='LC1685'>If I had advertised another miracle I couldn&#39;t have raised an</div><div class='line' id='LC1686'>audience with a sheriff.</div><div class='line' id='LC1687'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1688'>Merlin&#39;s stock was flat.  The king wanted to stop his wages; he</div><div class='line' id='LC1689'>even wanted to banish him, but I interfered.  I said he would be</div><div class='line' id='LC1690'>useful to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that,</div><div class='line' id='LC1691'>and I would give him a lift now and then when his poor little</div><div class='line' id='LC1692'>parlor-magic soured on him.  There wasn&#39;t a rag of his tower left,</div><div class='line' id='LC1693'>but I had the government rebuild it for him, and advised him</div><div class='line' id='LC1694'>to take boarders; but he was too high-toned for that.  And as for</div><div class='line' id='LC1695'>being grateful, he never even said thank you.  He was a rather</div><div class='line' id='LC1696'>hard lot, take him how you might; but then you couldn&#39;t fairly</div><div class='line' id='LC1697'>expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so.</div><div class='line' id='LC1698'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1699'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1700'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1701'>CHAPTER VIII</div><div class='line' id='LC1702'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1703'>THE BOSS</div><div class='line' id='LC1704'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1705'>To be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing; but to have</div><div class='line' id='LC1706'>the on-looking world consent to it is a finer.  The tower episode</div><div class='line' id='LC1707'>solidified my power, and made it impregnable.  If any were perchance</div><div class='line' id='LC1708'>disposed to be jealous and critical before that, they experienced</div><div class='line' id='LC1709'>a change of heart, now.  There was not any one in the kingdom</div><div class='line' id='LC1710'>who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters.</div><div class='line' id='LC1711'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1712'>I was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances.</div><div class='line' id='LC1713'>For a time, I used to wake up, mornings, and smile at my &quot;dream,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1714'>and listen for the Colt&#39;s factory whistle; but that sort of thing</div><div class='line' id='LC1715'>played itself out, gradually, and at last I was fully able to realize</div><div class='line' id='LC1716'>that I was actually living in the sixth century, and in Arthur&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC1717'>court, not a lunatic asylum.  After that, I was just as much</div><div class='line' id='LC1718'>at home in that century as I could have been in any other; and</div><div class='line' id='LC1719'>as for preference, I wouldn&#39;t have traded it for the twentieth.</div><div class='line' id='LC1720'>Look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge, brains,</div><div class='line' id='LC1721'>pluck, and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country.</div><div class='line' id='LC1722'>The grandest field that ever was; and all my own; not a competitor;</div><div class='line' id='LC1723'>not a man who wasn&#39;t a baby to me in acquirements and capacities;</div><div class='line' id='LC1724'>whereas, what would I amount to in the twentieth century?  I should</div><div class='line' id='LC1725'>be foreman of a factory, that is about all; and could drag a seine</div><div class='line' id='LC1726'>down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself.</div><div class='line' id='LC1727'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1728'>What a jump I had made!  I couldn&#39;t keep from thinking about it,</div><div class='line' id='LC1729'>and contemplating it, just as one does who has struck oil.  There</div><div class='line' id='LC1730'>was nothing back of me that could approach it, unless it might be</div><div class='line' id='LC1731'>Joseph&#39;s case; and Joseph&#39;s only approached it, it didn&#39;t equal</div><div class='line' id='LC1732'>it, quite.  For it stands to reason that as Joseph&#39;s splendid</div><div class='line' id='LC1733'>financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king, the general</div><div class='line' id='LC1734'>public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereas</div><div class='line' id='LC1735'>I had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and was</div><div class='line' id='LC1736'>popular by reason of it.</div><div class='line' id='LC1737'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1738'>I was no shadow of a king; I was the substance; the king himself</div><div class='line' id='LC1739'>was the shadow.  My power was colossal; and it was not a mere</div><div class='line' id='LC1740'>name, as such things have generally been, it was the genuine</div><div class='line' id='LC1741'>article.  I stood here, at the very spring and source of the second</div><div class='line' id='LC1742'>great period of the world&#39;s history; and could see the trickling</div><div class='line' id='LC1743'>stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden, and roll</div><div class='line' id='LC1744'>its mighty tides down the far centuries; and I could note the</div><div class='line' id='LC1745'>upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long</div><div class='line' id='LC1746'>array of thrones: De Montforts, Gavestons, Mortimers, Villierses;</div><div class='line' id='LC1747'>the war-making, campaign-directing wantons of France, and Charles</div><div class='line' id='LC1748'>the Second&#39;s scepter-wielding drabs; but nowhere in the procession</div><div class='line' id='LC1749'>was my full-sized fellow visible.  I was a Unique; and glad to know</div><div class='line' id='LC1750'>that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen</div><div class='line' id='LC1751'>centuries and a half, for sure.  Yes, in power I was equal to</div><div class='line' id='LC1752'>the king.  At the same time there was another power that was</div><div class='line' id='LC1753'>a trifle stronger than both of us put together.  That was the Church.</div><div class='line' id='LC1754'>I do not wish to disguise that fact.  I couldn&#39;t, if I wanted to.</div><div class='line' id='LC1755'>But never mind about that, now; it will show up, in its proper</div><div class='line' id='LC1756'>place, later on.

And the</div><div class='line' id='LC1760'>people!  They were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race;</div><div class='line' id='LC1761'>why, they were nothing but rabbits.  It was pitiful for a person</div><div class='line' id='LC1762'>born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble</div><div class='line' id='LC1763'>and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and Church</div><div class='line' id='LC1764'>and nobility; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor</div><div class='line' id='LC1765'>king and Church and noble than a slave has to love and honor</div><div class='line' id='LC1766'>the lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him!</div><div class='line' id='LC1767'>Why, dear me, _any_ kind of royalty, howsoever modified, _any_ kind</div><div class='line' id='LC1768'>of aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you</div><div class='line' id='LC1769'>are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably</div><div class='line' id='LC1770'>never find it out for yourself, and don&#39;t believe it when somebody</div><div class='line' id='LC1771'>else tells you.  It is enough to make a body ashamed of his race</div><div class='line' id='LC1772'>to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones</div><div class='line' id='LC1773'>without shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people</div><div class='line' id='LC1774'>that have always figured as its aristocracies--a company of monarchs</div><div class='line' id='LC1775'>and nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty and</div><div class='line' id='LC1776'>obscurity if left, like their betters, to their own exertions.</div><div class='line' id='LC1777'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1778'>The most of King Arthur&#39;s British nation were slaves, pure and</div><div class='line' id='LC1779'>simple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their</div><div class='line' id='LC1780'>necks; and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name;</div><div class='line' id='LC1781'>they imagined themselves men and freemen, and called themselves</div><div class='line' id='LC1782'>so.  The truth was, the nation as a body was in the world for one</div><div class='line' id='LC1783'>object, and one only: to grovel before king and Church and noble;</div><div class='line' id='LC1784'>to slave for them, sweat blood for them, starve that they might</div><div class='line' id='LC1785'>be fed, work that they might play, drink misery to the dregs that</div><div class='line' id='LC1786'>they might be happy, go naked that they might wear silks and</div><div class='line' id='LC1787'>jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them,</div><div class='line' id='LC1788'>be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures</div><div class='line' id='LC1789'>of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves</div><div class='line' id='LC1790'>the gods of this world.  And for all this, the thanks they got were</div><div class='line' id='LC1791'>cuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were they that they took</div><div class='line' id='LC1792'>even this sort of attention as an honor.</div><div class='line' id='LC1793'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1794'>Inherited ideas are a curious thing, and interesting to observe</div><div class='line' id='LC1795'>and examine.  I had mine, the king and his people had theirs.</div><div class='line' id='LC1796'>In both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit,</div><div class='line' id='LC1797'>and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason</div><div class='line' id='LC1798'>and argument would have had a long contract on his hands.  For</div><div class='line' id='LC1799'>instance, those people had inherited the idea that all men without</div><div class='line' id='LC1800'>title and a long pedigree, whether they had great natural gifts</div><div class='line' id='LC1801'>and acquirements or hadn&#39;t, were creatures of no more consideration</div><div class='line' id='LC1802'>than so many animals, bugs, insects; whereas I had inherited the idea</div><div class='line' id='LC1803'>that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams</div><div class='line' id='LC1804'>of inherited dignities and unearned titles, are of no good but</div><div class='line' id='LC1805'>to be laughed at.  The way I was looked upon was odd, but it was</div><div class='line' id='LC1806'>natural.  You know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant</div><div class='line' id='LC1807'>in the menagerie: well, that is the idea.  They are full of</div><div class='line' id='LC1808'>admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength; they</div><div class='line' id='LC1809'>speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels</div><div class='line' id='LC1810'>which are far and away beyond their own powers; and they speak</div><div class='line' id='LC1811'>with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able</div><div class='line' id='LC1812'>to drive a thousand men before him.  But does that make him one</div><div class='line' id='LC1813'>of _them_?  No; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at</div><div class='line' id='LC1814'>the idea.  He couldn&#39;t comprehend it; couldn&#39;t take it in; couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC1815'>in any remote way conceive of it.  Well, to the king, the nobles,</div><div class='line' id='LC1816'>and all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, I was</div><div class='line' id='LC1817'>just that kind of an elephant, and nothing more.  I was admired,</div><div class='line' id='LC1818'>also feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared.</div><div class='line' id='LC1819'>The animal is not reverenced, neither was I; I was not even</div><div class='line' id='LC1820'>respected.  I had no pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC1821'>and nobles&#39; eyes I was mere dirt; the people regarded me with</div><div class='line' id='LC1822'>wonder and awe, but there was no reverence mixed with it; through</div><div class='line' id='LC1823'>the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of</div><div class='line' id='LC1824'>anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship.</div><div class='line' id='LC1825'>There you see the hand of that awful power, the Roman Catholic</div><div class='line' id='LC1826'>Church.  In two or three little centuries it had converted a nation</div><div class='line' id='LC1827'>of men to a nation of worms.  Before the day of the Church&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC1828'>supremacy in the world, men were men, and held their heads up,</div><div class='line' id='LC1829'>and had a man&#39;s pride and spirit and independence; and what</div><div class='line' id='LC1830'>of greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement,</div><div class='line' id='LC1831'>not by birth.  But then the Church came to the front, with an axe</div><div class='line' id='LC1832'>to grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way</div><div class='line' id='LC1833'>to skin a cat--or a nation; she invented &quot;divine right of kings,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC1834'>and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes</div><div class='line' id='LC1835'>--wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify</div><div class='line' id='LC1836'>an evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience</div><div class='line' id='LC1837'>to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the</div><div class='line' id='LC1838'>commoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner,</div><div class='line' id='LC1839'>always to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance</div><div class='line' id='LC1840'>under oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and</div><div class='line' id='LC1841'>aristocracies, and taught all the Christian populations of the earth</div><div class='line' id='LC1842'>to bow down to them and worship them.  Even down to my birth-century</div><div class='line' id='LC1843'>that poison was still in the blood of Christendom, and the best</div><div class='line' id='LC1844'>of English commoners was still content to see his inferiors</div><div class='line' id='LC1845'>impudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such as</div><div class='line' id='LC1846'>lordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his country</div><div class='line' id='LC1847'>did not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contented</div><div class='line' id='LC1848'>with this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuade</div><div class='line' id='LC1849'>himself that he was proud of it.  It seems to show that there isn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC1850'>anything you can&#39;t stand, if you are only born and bred to it.</div><div class='line' id='LC1851'>Of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been</div><div class='line' id='LC1852'>in our American blood, too--I know that; but when I left America</div><div class='line' id='LC1853'>it had disappeared--at least to all intents and purposes.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC1854'>remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses.  When</div><div class='line' id='LC1855'>a disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly</div><div class='line' id='LC1856'>be said to be out of the system.</div><div class='line' id='LC1857'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1858'>But to return to my anomalous position in King Arthur&#39;s kingdom.</div><div class='line' id='LC1859'>Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master</div><div class='line' id='LC1860'>intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement</div><div class='line' id='LC1861'>the one and only actually great man in that whole British world;</div><div class='line' id='LC1862'>and yet there and then, just as in the remote England of my</div><div class='line' id='LC1863'>birth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent</div><div class='line' id='LC1864'>from a king&#39;s leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of</div><div class='line' id='LC1865'>London, was a better man than I was.  Such a personage was fawned</div><div class='line' id='LC1866'>upon in Arthur&#39;s realm and reverently looked up to by everybody,</div><div class='line' id='LC1867'>even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence,</div><div class='line' id='LC1868'>and his morals as base as his lineage.  There were times when</div><div class='line' id='LC1869'>_he_ could sit down in the king&#39;s presence, but I couldn&#39;t.  I could</div><div class='line' id='LC1870'>have got a title easily enough, and that would have raised me</div><div class='line' id='LC1871'>a large step in everybody&#39;s eyes; even in the king&#39;s, the giver</div><div class='line' id='LC1872'>of it.  But I didn&#39;t ask for it; and I declined it when it was</div><div class='line' id='LC1873'>offered.  I couldn&#39;t have enjoyed such a thing with my notions;</div><div class='line' id='LC1874'>and it wouldn&#39;t have been fair, anyway, because as far back as</div><div class='line' id='LC1875'>I could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister.</div><div class='line' id='LC1876'>I couldn&#39;t have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud</div><div class='line' id='LC1877'>and set-up over any title except one that should come from the nation</div><div class='line' id='LC1878'>itself, the only legitimate source; and such an one I hoped to win;</div><div class='line' id='LC1879'>and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor, I did</div><div class='line' id='LC1880'>win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride.  This title</div><div class='line' id='LC1881'>fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village,</div><div class='line' id='LC1882'>was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth</div><div class='line' id='LC1883'>with a laugh and an affirmative vote; in ten days it had swept</div><div class='line' id='LC1884'>the kingdom, and was become as familiar as the king&#39;s name.  I was</div><div class='line' id='LC1885'>never known by any other designation afterward, whether in the</div><div class='line' id='LC1886'>nation&#39;s talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the</div><div class='line' id='LC1887'>council-board of the sovereign.  This title, translated into modern</div><div class='line' id='LC1888'>speech, would be THE BOSS.  Elected by the nation.  That suited me.</div><div class='line' id='LC1889'>And it was a pretty high title.  There were very few THE&#39;S, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1890'>I was one of them.  If you spoke of the duke, or the earl, or</div><div class='line' id='LC1891'>the bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant?  But if</div><div class='line' id='LC1892'>you spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss, it was different.</div><div class='line' id='LC1893'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1894'>Well, I liked the king, and as king I respected him--respected</div><div class='line' id='LC1895'>the office; at least respected it as much as I was capable of</div><div class='line' id='LC1896'>respecting any unearned supremacy; but as MEN I looked down upon</div><div class='line' id='LC1897'>him and his nobles--privately.  And he and they liked me, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1898'>respected my office; but as an animal, without birth or sham title,</div><div class='line' id='LC1899'>they looked down upon me--and were not particularly private about it,</div><div class='line' id='LC1900'>either.  I didn&#39;t charge for my opinion about them, and they didn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC1901'>charge for their opinion about me: the account was square, the</div><div class='line' id='LC1902'>books balanced, everybody was satisfied.</div><div class='line' id='LC1903'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1904'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1905'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1906'>CHAPTER IX</div><div class='line' id='LC1907'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1908'>THE TOURNAMENT</div><div class='line' id='LC1909'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1910'>They were always having grand tournaments there at Camelot; and</div><div class='line' id='LC1911'>very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull-fights</div><div class='line' id='LC1912'>they were, too, but just a little wearisome to the practical mind.</div><div class='line' id='LC1913'>However, I was generally on hand--for two reasons: a man must</div><div class='line' id='LC1914'>not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his</div><div class='line' id='LC1915'>community have at heart if he would be liked--especially as</div><div class='line' id='LC1916'>a statesman; and both as business man and statesman I wanted</div><div class='line' id='LC1917'>to study the tournament and see if I couldn&#39;t invent an improvement</div><div class='line' id='LC1918'>on it.  That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first</div><div class='line' id='LC1919'>official thing I did, in my administration--and it was on the very</div><div class='line' id='LC1920'>first day of it, too--was to start a patent office; for I knew</div><div class='line' id='LC1921'>that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was</div><div class='line' id='LC1922'>just a crab, and couldn&#39;t travel any way but sideways or backways.</div><div class='line' id='LC1923'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1924'>Things ran along, a tournament nearly every week; and now and then</div><div class='line' id='LC1925'>the boys used to want me to take a hand--I mean Sir Launcelot and</div><div class='line' id='LC1926'>the rest--but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much</div><div class='line' id='LC1927'>government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.</div><div class='line' id='LC1928'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1929'>We had one tournament which was continued from day to day during</div><div class='line' id='LC1930'>more than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took part</div><div class='line' id='LC1931'>in it, from first to last.  They were weeks gathering.  They came</div><div class='line' id='LC1932'>on horseback from everywhere; from the very ends of the country,</div><div class='line' id='LC1933'>and even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies, and all</div><div class='line' id='LC1934'>brought squires and troops of servants.  It was a most gaudy and</div><div class='line' id='LC1935'>gorgeous crowd, as to costumery, and very characteristic of the</div><div class='line' id='LC1936'>country and the time, in the way of high animal spirits, innocent</div><div class='line' id='LC1937'>indecencies of language, and happy-hearted indifference to morals.</div><div class='line' id='LC1938'>It was fight or look on, all day and every day; and sing, gamble,</div><div class='line' id='LC1939'>dance, carouse half the night every night.  They had a most noble</div><div class='line' id='LC1940'>good time.  You never saw such people.  Those banks of beautiful</div><div class='line' id='LC1941'>ladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would see a knight</div><div class='line' id='LC1942'>sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness</div><div class='line' id='LC1943'>of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, and instead</div><div class='line' id='LC1944'>of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a</div><div class='line' id='LC1945'>better view; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief,</div><div class='line' id='LC1946'>and look ostentatiously broken-hearted, and then you could lay</div><div class='line' id='LC1947'>two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was</div><div class='line' id='LC1948'>afraid the public hadn&#39;t found it out.</div><div class='line' id='LC1949'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1950'>The noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily, but</div><div class='line' id='LC1951'>I didn&#39;t mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me</div><div class='line' id='LC1952'>from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC1953'>cripples.  They ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me,</div><div class='line' id='LC1954'>and broke the saw-buck, too, but I let it pass.  And as for my</div><div class='line' id='LC1955'>axe--well, I made up my mind that the next time I lent an axe</div><div class='line' id='LC1956'>to a surgeon I would pick my century.</div><div class='line' id='LC1957'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1958'>I not only watched this tournament from day to day, but detailed</div><div class='line' id='LC1959'>an intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and</div><div class='line' id='LC1960'>Agriculture, and ordered him to report it; for it was my purpose</div><div class='line' id='LC1961'>by and by, when I should have gotten the people along far enough,</div><div class='line' id='LC1962'>to start a newspaper.  The first thing you want in a new country,</div><div class='line' id='LC1963'>is a patent office; then work up your school system; and after that,</div><div class='line' id='LC1964'>out with your paper.  A newspaper has its faults, and plenty of them,</div><div class='line' id='LC1965'>but no matter, it&#39;s hark from the tomb for a dead nation, and don&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC1966'>you forget it.  You can&#39;t resurrect a dead nation without it; there</div><div class='line' id='LC1967'>isn&#39;t any way.  So I wanted to sample things, and be finding out</div><div class='line' id='LC1968'>what sort of reporter-material I might be able to rake together out</div><div class='line' id='LC1969'>of the sixth century when I should come to need it.</div><div class='line' id='LC1970'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1971'>Well, the priest did very well, considering.  He got in all</div><div class='line' id='LC1972'>the details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see,</div><div class='line' id='LC1973'>he had kept books for the undertaker-department of his church</div><div class='line' id='LC1974'>when he was younger, and there, you know, the money&#39;s in the details;</div><div class='line' id='LC1975'>the more details, the more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers</div><div class='line' id='LC1976'>--everything counts; and if the bereaved don&#39;t buy prayers enough</div><div class='line' id='LC1977'>you mark up your candles with a forked pencil, and your bill</div><div class='line' id='LC1978'>shows up all right.  And he had a good knack at getting in the</div><div class='line' id='LC1979'>complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely</div><div class='line' id='LC1980'>to advertise--no, I mean a knight that had influence; and he also</div><div class='line' id='LC1981'>had a neat gift of exaggeration, for in his time he had kept door</div><div class='line' id='LC1982'>for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles.</div><div class='line' id='LC1983'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1984'>Of course this novice&#39;s report lacked whoop and crash and lurid</div><div class='line' id='LC1985'>description, and therefore wanted the true ring; but its antique</div><div class='line' id='LC1986'>wording was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrances</div><div class='line' id='LC1987'>and flavors of the time, and these little merits made up in a measure</div><div class='line' id='LC1988'>for its more important lacks.  Here is an extract from it:</div><div class='line' id='LC1989'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC1990'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum,</div><div class='line' id='LC1991'>&nbsp;&nbsp;knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale and</div><div class='line' id='LC1992'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Tor, and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore Grummorsum</div><div class='line' id='LC1993'>&nbsp;&nbsp;to the earth.  Then came Sir Carados of the dolorous</div><div class='line' id='LC1994'>&nbsp;&nbsp;tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1995'>&nbsp;&nbsp;there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis</div><div class='line' id='LC1996'>&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sir Lamorak de Galis, that were two brethren, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1997'>&nbsp;&nbsp;there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir Carados, and</div><div class='line' id='LC1998'>&nbsp;&nbsp;either brake their spears unto their hands, and then</div><div class='line' id='LC1999'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote</div><div class='line' id='LC2000'>&nbsp;&nbsp;down other, horse and all, to the earth, and either</div><div class='line' id='LC2001'>&nbsp;&nbsp;parties rescued other and horsed them again.  And Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC2002'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Arnold, and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,</div><div class='line' id='LC2003'>&nbsp;&nbsp;encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these</div><div class='line' id='LC2004'>&nbsp;&nbsp;four knights encountered mightily, and brake their</div><div class='line' id='LC2005'>&nbsp;&nbsp;spears to their hands.  Then came Sir Pertolope from</div><div class='line' id='LC2006'>&nbsp;&nbsp;the castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel,</div><div class='line' id='LC2007'>&nbsp;&nbsp;and there Sir Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC2008'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot.  All this was marked</div><div class='line' id='LC2009'>&nbsp;&nbsp;by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.</div><div class='line' id='LC2010'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sir Bleobaris brake his spear upon Sir Gareth,</div><div class='line' id='LC2011'>&nbsp;&nbsp;but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth.</div><div class='line' id='LC2012'>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sir Galihodin saw that, he bad Sir Gareth keep him,</div><div class='line' id='LC2013'>&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sir Gareth smote him to the earth.  Then Sir Galihud</div><div class='line' id='LC2014'>&nbsp;&nbsp;gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise</div><div class='line' id='LC2015'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan and his brother</div><div class='line' id='LC2016'>&nbsp;&nbsp;La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Disirous, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2017'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Dodinas le Savage; all these he bare down with one</div><div class='line' id='LC2018'>&nbsp;&nbsp;spear.  When King Aswisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth</div><div class='line' id='LC2019'>&nbsp;&nbsp;fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one time</div><div class='line' id='LC2020'>&nbsp;&nbsp;seemed green, and another time, at his again coming,</div><div class='line' id='LC2021'>&nbsp;&nbsp;he seemed blue.  And thus at every course that he rode</div><div class='line' id='LC2022'>&nbsp;&nbsp;to and fro he changed his color, so that there might</div><div class='line' id='LC2023'>&nbsp;&nbsp;neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him.</div><div class='line' id='LC2024'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Sir Agwisance the King of Ireland encountered</div><div class='line' id='LC2025'>&nbsp;&nbsp;with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from</div><div class='line' id='LC2026'>&nbsp;&nbsp;his horse, saddle and all.  And then came King Carados</div><div class='line' id='LC2027'>&nbsp;&nbsp;of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and</div><div class='line' id='LC2028'>&nbsp;&nbsp;man.  And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the</div><div class='line' id='LC2029'>&nbsp;&nbsp;land of Gore.  And then there came in Sir Bagdemagus,</div><div class='line' id='LC2030'>&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man to the</div><div class='line' id='LC2031'>&nbsp;&nbsp;earth.  And Bagdemagus&#39;s son Meliganus brake a spear</div><div class='line' id='LC2032'>&nbsp;&nbsp;upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly.  And then Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC2033'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Galahault the noble prince cried on high, Knight with</div><div class='line' id='LC2034'>&nbsp;&nbsp;the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee</div><div class='line' id='LC2035'>&nbsp;&nbsp;ready that I may just with thee.  Sir Gareth heard him,</div><div class='line' id='LC2036'>&nbsp;&nbsp;and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered</div><div class='line' id='LC2037'>&nbsp;&nbsp;together, and there the prince brake his spear; but Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC2038'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that</div><div class='line' id='LC2039'>&nbsp;&nbsp;he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not</div><div class='line' id='LC2040'>&nbsp;&nbsp;his men recovered him.  Truly, said King Arthur, that</div><div class='line' id='LC2041'>&nbsp;&nbsp;knight with the many colors is a good knight.  Wherefore</div><div class='line' id='LC2042'>&nbsp;&nbsp;the king called unto him Sir Launcelot, and prayed him</div><div class='line' id='LC2043'>&nbsp;&nbsp;to encounter with that knight.  Sir, said Launcelot, I</div><div class='line' id='LC2044'>&nbsp;&nbsp;may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at</div><div class='line' id='LC2045'>&nbsp;&nbsp;this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2046'>&nbsp;&nbsp;when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is</div><div class='line' id='LC2047'>&nbsp;&nbsp;no good knight&#39;s part to let him of his worship, and,</div><div class='line' id='LC2048'>&nbsp;&nbsp;namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great</div><div class='line' id='LC2049'>&nbsp;&nbsp;labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his</div><div class='line' id='LC2050'>&nbsp;&nbsp;quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best</div><div class='line' id='LC2051'>&nbsp;&nbsp;beloved with this lady of all that be here, for I see</div><div class='line' id='LC2052'>&nbsp;&nbsp;well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great</div><div class='line' id='LC2053'>&nbsp;&nbsp;deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me,</div><div class='line' id='LC2054'>&nbsp;&nbsp;this day he shall have the honour; though it lay in my</div><div class='line' id='LC2055'>&nbsp;&nbsp;power to put him from it, I would not.</div><div class='line' id='LC2056'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2057'>There was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons</div><div class='line' id='LC2058'>of state I struck out of my priest&#39;s report.  You will have noticed</div><div class='line' id='LC2059'>that Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.  When</div><div class='line' id='LC2060'>I say Garry I mean Sir Gareth.  Garry was my private pet name</div><div class='line' id='LC2061'>for him; it suggests that I had a deep affection for him, and that</div><div class='line' id='LC2062'>was the case.  But it was a private pet name only, and never spoken</div><div class='line' id='LC2063'>aloud to any one, much less to him; being a noble, he would not</div><div class='line' id='LC2064'>have endured a familiarity like that from me.  Well, to proceed:</div><div class='line' id='LC2065'>I sat in the private box set apart for me as the king&#39;s minister.</div><div class='line' id='LC2066'>While Sir Dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists,</div><div class='line' id='LC2067'>he came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was always</div><div class='line' id='LC2068'>making up to me, because I was a stranger and he liked to have</div><div class='line' id='LC2069'>a fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached that</div><div class='line' id='LC2070'>stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while</div><div class='line' id='LC2071'>the other person looks sick.  I had always responded to his efforts</div><div class='line' id='LC2072'>as well as I could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him,</div><div class='line' id='LC2073'>too, for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one</div><div class='line' id='LC2074'>particular anecdote which I had heard oftenest and had most hated</div><div class='line' id='LC2075'>and most loathed all my life, he had at least spared it me.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC2076'>one which I had heard attributed to every humorous person who</div><div class='line' id='LC2077'>had ever stood on American soil, from Columbus down to Artemus Ward.</div><div class='line' id='LC2078'>It was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience</div><div class='line' id='LC2079'>with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh; and</div><div class='line' id='LC2080'>then when he was leaving, some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully</div><div class='line' id='LC2081'>by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever</div><div class='line' id='LC2082'>heard, and &quot;it was all they could do to keep from laughin&#39; right</div><div class='line' id='LC2083'>out in meetin&#39;.&quot;  That anecdote never saw the day that it was</div><div class='line' id='LC2084'>worth the telling; and yet I had sat under the telling of it</div><div class='line' id='LC2085'>hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2086'>cried and cursed all the way through.  Then who can hope to know</div><div class='line' id='LC2087'>what my feelings were, to hear this armor-plated ass start in on</div><div class='line' id='LC2088'>it again, in the murky twilight of tradition, before the dawn of</div><div class='line' id='LC2089'>history, while even Lactantius might be referred to as &quot;the late</div><div class='line' id='LC2090'>Lactantius,&quot; and the Crusades wouldn&#39;t be born for five hundred</div><div class='line' id='LC2091'>years yet?  Just as he finished, the call-boy came; so, haw-hawing</div><div class='line' id='LC2092'>like a demon, he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of</div><div class='line' id='LC2093'>loose castings, and I knew nothing more.  It was some minutes</div><div class='line' id='LC2094'>before I came to, and then I opened my eyes just in time to see</div><div class='line' id='LC2095'>Sir Gareth fetch him an awful welt, and I unconsciously out with</div><div class='line' id='LC2096'>the prayer, &quot;I hope to gracious he&#39;s killed!&quot;  But by ill-luck,</div><div class='line' id='LC2097'>before I had got half through with the words, Sir Gareth crashed</div><div class='line' id='LC2098'>into Sir Sagramor le Desirous and sent him thundering over his</div><div class='line' id='LC2099'>horse&#39;s crupper, and Sir Sagramor caught my remark and thought</div><div class='line' id='LC2100'>I meant it for _him_.</div><div class='line' id='LC2101'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2102'>Well, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head,</div><div class='line' id='LC2103'>there was no getting it out again.  I knew that, so I saved my</div><div class='line' id='LC2104'>breath, and offered no explanations.  As soon as Sir Sagramor</div><div class='line' id='LC2105'>got well, he notified me that there was a little account to settle</div><div class='line' id='LC2106'>between us, and he named a day three or four years in the future;</div><div class='line' id='LC2107'>place of settlement, the lists where the offense had been given.</div><div class='line' id='LC2108'>I said I would be ready when he got back.  You see, he was going</div><div class='line' id='LC2109'>for the Holy Grail.  The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail</div><div class='line' id='LC2110'>now and then.  It was a several years&#39; cruise.  They always put in</div><div class='line' id='LC2111'>the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way,</div><div class='line' id='LC2112'>though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was,</div><div class='line' id='LC2113'>and I don&#39;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or</div><div class='line' id='LC2114'>would have known what to do with it if he _had_ run across it.</div><div class='line' id='LC2115'>You see, it was just the Northwest Passage of that day, as you may</div><div class='line' id='LC2116'>say; that was all.  Every year expeditions went out holy grailing,</div><div class='line' id='LC2117'>and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for _them_.  There</div><div class='line' id='LC2118'>was worlds of reputation in it, but no money.  Why, they actually</div><div class='line' id='LC2119'>wanted _me_ to put in!  Well, I should smile.</div><div class='line' id='LC2120'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2121'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2122'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2123'>CHAPTER X</div><div class='line' id='LC2124'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2125'>BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION</div><div class='line' id='LC2126'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2127'>The Round Table soon heard of the challenge, and of course it was</div><div class='line' id='LC2128'>a good deal discussed, for such things interested the boys.</div><div class='line' id='LC2129'>The king thought I ought now to set forth in quest of adventures,</div><div class='line' id='LC2130'>so that I might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet</div><div class='line' id='LC2131'>Sir Sagramor when the several years should have rolled away.</div><div class='line' id='LC2132'>I excused myself for the present; I said it would take me three</div><div class='line' id='LC2133'>or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly;</div><div class='line' id='LC2134'>then I should be ready; all the chances were that at the end of</div><div class='line' id='LC2135'>that time Sir Sagramor would still be out grailing, so no valuable</div><div class='line' id='LC2136'>time would be lost by the postponement; I should then have been</div><div class='line' id='LC2137'>in office six or seven years, and I believed my system and machinery</div><div class='line' id='LC2138'>would be so well developed that I could take a holiday without</div><div class='line' id='LC2139'>its working any harm.</div><div class='line' id='LC2140'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2141'>I was pretty well satisfied with what I had already accomplished.</div><div class='line' id='LC2142'>In various quiet nooks and corners I had the beginnings of all</div><div class='line' id='LC2143'>sorts of industries under way--nuclei of future vast factories,</div><div class='line' id='LC2144'>the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization.  In these</div><div class='line' id='LC2145'>were gathered together the brightest young minds I could find,</div><div class='line' id='LC2146'>and I kept agents out raking the country for more, all the time.</div><div class='line' id='LC2147'>I was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts--experts</div><div class='line' id='LC2148'>in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling.  These nurseries</div><div class='line' id='LC2149'>of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their</div><div class='line' id='LC2150'>obscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into their</div><div class='line' id='LC2151'>precincts without a special permit--for I was afraid of the Church.</div><div class='line' id='LC2152'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2153'>I had started a teacher-factory and a lot of Sunday-schools the</div><div class='line' id='LC2154'>first thing; as a result, I now had an admirable system of graded</div><div class='line' id='LC2155'>schools in full blast in those places, and also a complete variety</div><div class='line' id='LC2156'>of Protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing</div><div class='line' id='LC2157'>condition.  Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted</div><div class='line' id='LC2158'>to; there was perfect freedom in that matter.  But I confined public</div><div class='line' id='LC2159'>religious teaching to the churches and the Sunday-schools, permitting</div><div class='line' id='LC2160'>nothing of it in my other educational buildings.  I could have</div><div class='line' id='LC2161'>given my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian</div><div class='line' id='LC2162'>without any trouble, but that would have been to affront a law</div><div class='line' id='LC2163'>of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in</div><div class='line' id='LC2164'>the human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2165'>features, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is</div><div class='line' id='LC2166'>equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and</div><div class='line' id='LC2167'>size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion,</div><div class='line' id='LC2168'>angularities, and stature of the individual who wears it; and,</div><div class='line' id='LC2169'>besides, I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty power,</div><div class='line' id='LC2170'>the mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets into</div><div class='line' id='LC2171'>selfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to</div><div class='line' id='LC2172'>human liberty and paralysis to human thought.</div><div class='line' id='LC2173'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2174'>All mines were royal property, and there were a good many of them.</div><div class='line' id='LC2175'>They had formerly been worked as savages always work mines--holes</div><div class='line' id='LC2176'>grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by</div><div class='line' id='LC2177'>hand, at the rate of a ton a day; but I had begun to put the mining</div><div class='line' id='LC2178'>on a scientific basis as early as I could.</div><div class='line' id='LC2179'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2180'>Yes, I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC2181'>challenge struck me.</div><div class='line' id='LC2182'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2183'>Four years rolled by--and then!  Well, you would never imagine</div><div class='line' id='LC2184'>it in the world.  Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in</div><div class='line' id='LC2185'>safe hands.  The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect</div><div class='line' id='LC2186'>government.  An earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect</div><div class='line' id='LC2187'>earthly government, if the conditions were the same, namely, the</div><div class='line' id='LC2188'>despot the perfectest individual of the human race, and his lease</div><div class='line' id='LC2189'>of life perpetual.  But as a perishable perfect man must die, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2190'>leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor, an</div><div class='line' id='LC2191'>earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government, it is</div><div class='line' id='LC2192'>the worst form that is possible.</div><div class='line' id='LC2193'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2194'>My works showed what a despot could do with the resources of</div><div class='line' id='LC2195'>a kingdom at his command.  Unsuspected by this dark land, I had</div><div class='line' id='LC2196'>the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very</div><div class='line' id='LC2197'>nose!  It was fenced away from the public view, but there it was,</div><div class='line' id='LC2198'>a gigantic and unassailable fact--and to be heard from, yet, if</div><div class='line' id='LC2199'>I lived and had luck.  There it was, as sure a fact and as substantial</div><div class='line' id='LC2200'>a fact as any serene volcano, standing innocent with its smokeless</div><div class='line' id='LC2201'>summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its</div><div class='line' id='LC2202'>bowels.  My schools and churches were children four years before;</div><div class='line' id='LC2203'>they were grown-up now; my shops of that day were vast factories</div><div class='line' id='LC2204'>now; where I had a dozen trained men then, I had a thousand now;</div><div class='line' id='LC2205'>where I had one brilliant expert then, I had fifty now.  I stood</div><div class='line' id='LC2206'>with my hand on the cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on and</div><div class='line' id='LC2207'>flood the midnight world with light at any moment.  But I was not</div><div class='line' id='LC2208'>going to do the thing in that sudden way.  It was not my policy.</div><div class='line' id='LC2209'>The people could not have stood it; and, moreover, I should have</div><div class='line' id='LC2210'>had the Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute.</div><div class='line' id='LC2211'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2212'>No, I had been going cautiously all the while.  I had had confidential</div><div class='line' id='LC2213'>agents trickling through the country some time, whose office was</div><div class='line' id='LC2214'>to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw</div><div class='line' id='LC2215'>a little at this and that and the other superstition, and so prepare</div><div class='line' id='LC2216'>the way gradually for a better order of things.  I was turning on</div><div class='line' id='LC2217'>my light one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so.</div><div class='line' id='LC2218'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2219'>I had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom,</div><div class='line' id='LC2220'>and they were doing very well.  I meant to work this racket more</div><div class='line' id='LC2221'>and more, as time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me.</div><div class='line' id='LC2222'>One of my deepest secrets was my West Point--my military academy.</div><div class='line' id='LC2223'>I kept that most jealously out of sight; and I did the same with my</div><div class='line' id='LC2224'>naval academy which I had established at a remote seaport.  Both</div><div class='line' id='LC2225'>were prospering to my satisfaction.</div><div class='line' id='LC2226'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2227'>Clarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my right</div><div class='line' id='LC2228'>hand.  He was a darling; he was equal to anything; there wasn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC2229'>anything he couldn&#39;t turn his hand to.  Of late I had been training</div><div class='line' id='LC2230'>him for journalism, for the time seemed about right for a start</div><div class='line' id='LC2231'>in the newspaper line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for</div><div class='line' id='LC2232'>experimental circulation in my civilization-nurseries.  He took</div><div class='line' id='LC2233'>to it like a duck; there was an editor concealed in him, sure.</div><div class='line' id='LC2234'>Already he had doubled himself in one way; he talked sixth century</div><div class='line' id='LC2235'>and wrote nineteenth.  His journalistic style was climbing,</div><div class='line' id='LC2236'>steadily; it was already up to the back settlement Alabama mark,</div><div class='line' id='LC2237'>and couldn&#39;t be told from the editorial output of that region</div><div class='line' id='LC2238'>either by matter or flavor.</div><div class='line' id='LC2239'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2240'>We had another large departure on hand, too.  This was a telegraph</div><div class='line' id='LC2241'>and a telephone; our first venture in this line.  These wires were</div><div class='line' id='LC2242'>for private service only, as yet, and must be kept private until</div><div class='line' id='LC2243'>a riper day should come.  We had a gang of men on the road, working</div><div class='line' id='LC2244'>mainly by night.  They were stringing ground wires; we were afraid</div><div class='line' id='LC2245'>to put up poles, for they would attract too much inquiry.  Ground</div><div class='line' id='LC2246'>wires were good enough, in both instances, for my wires were</div><div class='line' id='LC2247'>protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect.</div><div class='line' id='LC2248'>My men had orders to strike across country, avoiding roads, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2249'>establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights</div><div class='line' id='LC2250'>betrayed their presence, and leaving experts in charge. Nobody</div><div class='line' id='LC2251'>could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom, for nobody</div><div class='line' id='LC2252'>ever went intentionally to any place, but only struck it by</div><div class='line' id='LC2253'>accident in his wanderings, and then generally left it without</div><div class='line' id='LC2254'>thinking to inquire what its name was.  At one time and another</div><div class='line' id='LC2255'>we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the</div><div class='line' id='LC2256'>kingdom, but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble.</div><div class='line' id='LC2257'>So we had given the thing up, for the present; it would be poor</div><div class='line' id='LC2258'>wisdom to antagonize the Church.</div><div class='line' id='LC2259'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2260'>As for the general condition of the country, it was as it had been</div><div class='line' id='LC2261'>when I arrived in it, to all intents and purposes.  I had made</div><div class='line' id='LC2262'>changes, but they were necessarily slight, and they were not</div><div class='line' id='LC2263'>noticeable.  Thus far, I had not even meddled with taxation,</div><div class='line' id='LC2264'>outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues.  I had</div><div class='line' id='LC2265'>systematized those, and put the service on an effective and</div><div class='line' id='LC2266'>righteous basis.  As a result, these revenues were already quadrupled,</div><div class='line' id='LC2267'>and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than</div><div class='line' id='LC2268'>before, that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief, and the praises</div><div class='line' id='LC2269'>of my administration were hearty and general.</div><div class='line' id='LC2270'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2271'>Personally, I struck an interruption, now, but I did not mind it,</div><div class='line' id='LC2272'>it could not have happened at a better time.  Earlier it could</div><div class='line' id='LC2273'>have annoyed me, but now everything was in good hands and swimming</div><div class='line' id='LC2274'>right along.  The king had reminded me several times, of late, that</div><div class='line' id='LC2275'>the postponement I had asked for, four years before, had about</div><div class='line' id='LC2276'>run out now.  It was a hint that I ought to be starting out to seek</div><div class='line' id='LC2277'>adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy</div><div class='line' id='LC2278'>of the honor of breaking a lance with Sir Sagramor, who was still</div><div class='line' id='LC2279'>out grailing, but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions,</div><div class='line' id='LC2280'>and might be found any year, now.  So you see I was expecting</div><div class='line' id='LC2281'>this interruption; it did not take me by surprise.</div><div class='line' id='LC2282'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2283'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2284'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2285'>CHAPTER XI</div><div class='line' id='LC2286'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2287'>THE YANKEE IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURES</div><div class='line' id='LC2288'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2289'>There never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were</div><div class='line' id='LC2290'>of both sexes.  Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps</div><div class='line' id='LC2291'>arriving; and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or</div><div class='line' id='LC2292'>other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where</div><div class='line' id='LC2293'>she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant.</div><div class='line' id='LC2294'>Now you would think that the first thing the king would do after</div><div class='line' id='LC2295'>listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger, would be</div><div class='line' id='LC2296'>to ask for credentials--yes, and a pointer or two as to locality</div><div class='line' id='LC2297'>of castle, best route to it, and so on.  But nobody ever thought</div><div class='line' id='LC2298'>of so simple and common-sense a thing at that.  No, everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC2299'>swallowed these people&#39;s lies whole, and never asked a question</div><div class='line' id='LC2300'>of any sort or about anything.  Well, one day when I was not</div><div class='line' id='LC2301'>around, one of these people came along--it was a she one, this</div><div class='line' id='LC2302'>time--and told a tale of the usual pattern.  Her mistress was</div><div class='line' id='LC2303'>a captive in a vast and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other</div><div class='line' id='LC2304'>young and beautiful girls, pretty much all of them princesses;</div><div class='line' id='LC2305'>they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six</div><div class='line' id='LC2306'>years; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers,</div><div class='line' id='LC2307'>each with four arms and one eye--the eye in the center of the</div><div class='line' id='LC2308'>forehead, and as big as a fruit.  Sort of fruit not mentioned;</div><div class='line' id='LC2309'>their usual slovenliness in statistics.</div><div class='line' id='LC2310'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2311'>Would you believe it?  The king and the whole Round Table were</div><div class='line' id='LC2312'>in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure.</div><div class='line' id='LC2313'>Every knight of the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it;</div><div class='line' id='LC2314'>but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me,</div><div class='line' id='LC2315'>who had not asked for it at all.</div><div class='line' id='LC2316'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2317'>By an effort, I contained my joy when Clarence brought me the news.</div><div class='line' id='LC2318'>But he--he could not contain his.

And in a way it was true; I was as</div><div class='line' id='LC2328'>glad as a person is when he is scalped.</div><div class='line' id='LC2329'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2330'>Well, one must make the best of things, and not waste time with</div><div class='line' id='LC2331'>useless fretting, but get down to business and see what can be</div><div class='line' id='LC2332'>done.  In all lies there is wheat among the chaff; I must get at</div><div class='line' id='LC2333'>the wheat in this case: so I sent for the girl and she came.  She</div><div class='line' id='LC2334'>was a comely enough creature, and soft and modest, but, if signs</div><div class='line' id='LC2335'>went for anything, she didn&#39;t know as much as a lady&#39;s watch.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC2336'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2337'>&quot;My dear, have you been questioned as to particulars?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC2338'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2339'>She said she hadn&#39;t.</div><div class='line' id='LC2340'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2341'>&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t expect you had, but I thought I would ask, to make</div><div class='line' id='LC2342'>sure; it&#39;s the way I&#39;ve been raised.

Well, they</div><div class='line' id='LC2500'>_were_ good children--but just children, that is all.  And they</div><div class='line' id='LC2501'>gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants, and how</div><div class='line' id='LC2502'>to scoop them in; and they told me all sorts of charms against</div><div class='line' id='LC2503'>enchantments, and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my</div><div class='line' id='LC2504'>wounds.  But it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if</div><div class='line' id='LC2505'>I was such a wonderful necromancer as I was pretending to be,</div><div class='line' id='LC2506'>I ought not to need salves or instructions, or charms against</div><div class='line' id='LC2507'>enchantments, and, least of all, arms and armor, on a foray of any</div><div class='line' id='LC2508'>kind--even against fire-spouting dragons, and devils hot from</div><div class='line' id='LC2509'>perdition, let alone such poor adversaries as these I was after,</div><div class='line' id='LC2510'>these commonplace ogres of the back settlements.</div><div class='line' id='LC2511'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2512'>I was to have an early breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was</div><div class='line' id='LC2513'>the usual way; but I had the demon&#39;s own time with my armor,</div><div class='line' id='LC2514'>and this delayed me a little.  It is troublesome to get into, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2515'>there is so much detail.  First you wrap a layer or two of blanket</div><div class='line' id='LC2516'>around your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold</div><div class='line' id='LC2517'>iron; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail--these</div><div class='line' id='LC2518'>are made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric</div><div class='line' id='LC2519'>so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps</div><div class='line' id='LC2520'>into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and</div><div class='line' id='LC2521'>is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night</div><div class='line' id='LC2522'>shirt, yet plenty used it for that--tax collectors, and reformers,</div><div class='line' id='LC2523'>and one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of</div><div class='line' id='LC2524'>people; then you put on your shoes--flat-boats roofed over with</div><div class='line' id='LC2525'>interleaving bands of steel--and screw your clumsy spurs into</div><div class='line' id='LC2526'>the heels.  Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your</div><div class='line' id='LC2527'>cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate,</div><div class='line' id='LC2528'>and you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate</div><div class='line' id='LC2529'>the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs</div><div class='line' id='LC2530'>down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down,</div><div class='line' id='LC2531'>and isn&#39;t any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either</div><div class='line' id='LC2532'>for looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt</div><div class='line' id='LC2533'>on your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms,</div><div class='line' id='LC2534'>your iron gauntlets onto your hands, your iron rat-trap onto your</div><div class='line' id='LC2535'>head, with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back</div><div class='line' id='LC2536'>of your neck--and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould.</div><div class='line' id='LC2537'>This is no time to dance.  Well, a man that is packed away like</div><div class='line' id='LC2538'>that is a nut that isn&#39;t worth the cracking, there is so little of</div><div class='line' id='LC2539'>the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell.</div><div class='line' id='LC2540'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2541'>The boys helped me, or I never could have got in.  Just as we</div><div class='line' id='LC2542'>finished, Sir Bedivere happened in, and I saw that as like as not</div><div class='line' id='LC2543'>I hadn&#39;t chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip.  How</div><div class='line' id='LC2544'>stately he looked; and tall and broad and grand.  He had on his</div><div class='line' id='LC2545'>head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2546'>for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his</div><div class='line' id='LC2547'>upper lip and protected his nose; and all the rest of him, from</div><div class='line' id='LC2548'>neck to heel, was flexible chain mail, trousers and all.  But</div><div class='line' id='LC2549'>pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment, which</div><div class='line' id='LC2550'>of course was of chain mail, as I said, and hung straight from his</div><div class='line' id='LC2551'>shoulders to his ankles; and from his middle to the bottom, both</div><div class='line' id='LC2552'>before and behind, was divided, so that he could ride and let the</div><div class='line' id='LC2553'>skirts hang down on each side.  He was going grailing, and it was</div><div class='line' id='LC2554'>just the outfit for it, too.  I would have given a good deal for</div><div class='line' id='LC2555'>that ulster, but it was too late now to be fooling around.  The sun</div><div class='line' id='LC2556'>was just up, the king and the court were all on hand to see me off</div><div class='line' id='LC2557'>and wish me luck; so it wouldn&#39;t be etiquette for me to tarry.</div><div class='line' id='LC2558'>You don&#39;t get on your horse yourself; no, if you tried it you</div><div class='line' id='LC2559'>would get disappointed.  They carry you out, just as they carry</div><div class='line' id='LC2560'>a sun-struck man to the drug store, and put you on, and help get</div><div class='line' id='LC2561'>you to rights, and fix your feet in the stirrups; and all the while</div><div class='line' id='LC2562'>you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else--like</div><div class='line' id='LC2563'>somebody that has been married on a sudden, or struck by lightning,</div><div class='line' id='LC2564'>or something like that, and hasn&#39;t quite fetched around yet, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2565'>is sort of numb, and can&#39;t just get his bearings.  Then they</div><div class='line' id='LC2566'>stood up the mast they called a spear, in its socket by my left</div><div class='line' id='LC2567'>foot, and I gripped it with my hand; lastly they hung my shield</div><div class='line' id='LC2568'>around my neck, and I was all complete and ready to up anchor</div><div class='line' id='LC2569'>and get to sea.  Everybody was as good to me as they could be,</div><div class='line' id='LC2570'>and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self.  There was</div><div class='line' id='LC2571'>nothing more to do now, but for that damsel to get up behind me on</div><div class='line' id='LC2572'>a pillion, which she did, and put an arm or so around me to hold on.</div><div class='line' id='LC2573'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2574'>And so we started, and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their</div><div class='line' id='LC2575'>handkerchiefs or helmets.  And everybody we met, going down the hill</div><div class='line' id='LC2576'>and through the village was respectful to us, except some shabby</div><div class='line' id='LC2577'>little boys on the outskirts.  They said:</div><div class='line' id='LC2578'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2579'>&quot;Oh, what a guy!&quot;  And hove clods at us.</div><div class='line' id='LC2580'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2581'>In my experience boys are the same in all ages.  They don&#39;t respect</div><div class='line' id='LC2582'>anything, they don&#39;t care for anything or anybody.  They say</div><div class='line' id='LC2583'>&quot;Go up, baldhead&quot; to the prophet going his unoffending way in</div><div class='line' id='LC2584'>the gray of antiquity; they sass me in the holy gloom of the</div><div class='line' id='LC2585'>Middle Ages; and I had seen them act the same way in Buchanan&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC2586'>administration; I remember, because I was there and helped.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC2587'>prophet had his bears and settled with his boys; and I wanted</div><div class='line' id='LC2588'>to get down and settle with mine, but it wouldn&#39;t answer, because</div><div class='line' id='LC2589'>I couldn&#39;t have got up again.  I hate a country without a derrick.</div><div class='line' id='LC2590'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2591'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2592'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2593'>CHAPTER XII</div><div class='line' id='LC2594'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2595'>SLOW TORTURE</div><div class='line' id='LC2596'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2597'>Straight off, we were in the country.  It was most lovely and</div><div class='line' id='LC2598'>pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning</div><div class='line' id='LC2599'>in the first freshness of autumn.  From hilltops we saw fair</div><div class='line' id='LC2600'>green valleys lying spread out below, with streams winding through</div><div class='line' id='LC2601'>them, and island groves of trees here and there, and huge lonely</div><div class='line' id='LC2602'>oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade; and beyond</div><div class='line' id='LC2603'>the valleys we saw the ranges of hills, blue with haze, stretching</div><div class='line' id='LC2604'>away in billowy perspective to the horizon, with at wide intervals</div><div class='line' id='LC2605'>a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave-summit, which we knew was</div><div class='line' id='LC2606'>a castle.  We crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew,</div><div class='line' id='LC2607'>and we moved like spirits, the cushioned turf giving out no sound</div><div class='line' id='LC2608'>of footfall; we dreamed along through glades in a mist of green</div><div class='line' id='LC2609'>light that got its tint from the sun-drenched roof of leaves</div><div class='line' id='LC2610'>overhead, and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets</div><div class='line' id='LC2611'>went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of</div><div class='line' id='LC2612'>whispering music, comfortable to hear; and at times we left the</div><div class='line' id='LC2613'>world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich</div><div class='line' id='LC2614'>gloom of the forest, where furtive wild things whisked and scurried</div><div class='line' id='LC2615'>by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place</div><div class='line' id='LC2616'>where the noise was; and where only the earliest birds were turning</div><div class='line' id='LC2617'>out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder</div><div class='line' id='LC2618'>and a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming for worms on</div><div class='line' id='LC2619'>a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of</div><div class='line' id='LC2620'>the woods.  And by and by out we would swing again into the glare.</div><div class='line' id='LC2621'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2622'>About the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into</div><div class='line' id='LC2623'>the glare--it was along there somewhere, a couple of hours or so</div><div class='line' id='LC2624'>after sun-up--it wasn&#39;t as pleasant as it had been.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC2625'>beginning to get hot.  This was quite noticeable.  We had a very</div><div class='line' id='LC2626'>long pull, after that, without any shade.  Now it is curious how</div><div class='line' id='LC2627'>progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get</div><div class='line' id='LC2628'>a start.  Things which I didn&#39;t mind at all, at first, I began</div><div class='line' id='LC2629'>to mind now--and more and more, too, all the time.  The first</div><div class='line' id='LC2630'>ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief I didn&#39;t seem to care;</div><div class='line' id='LC2631'>I got along, and said never mind, it isn&#39;t any matter, and dropped</div><div class='line' id='LC2632'>it out of my mind.  But now it was different; I wanted it all</div><div class='line' id='LC2633'>the time; it was nag, nag, nag, right along, and no rest; I couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC2634'>get it out of my mind; and so at last I lost my temper and said</div><div class='line' id='LC2635'>hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets</div><div class='line' id='LC2636'>in it.  You see I had my handkerchief in my helmet; and some other</div><div class='line' id='LC2637'>things; but it was that kind of a helmet that you can&#39;t take off</div><div class='line' id='LC2638'>by yourself.  That hadn&#39;t occurred to me when I put it there;</div><div class='line' id='LC2639'>and in fact I didn&#39;t know it.  I supposed it would be particularly</div><div class='line' id='LC2640'>convenient there.  And so now, the thought of its being there,</div><div class='line' id='LC2641'>so handy and close by, and yet not get-at-able, made it all the</div><div class='line' id='LC2642'>worse and the harder to bear.  Yes, the thing that you can&#39;t get</div><div class='line' id='LC2643'>is the thing that you want, mainly; every one has noticed that.</div><div class='line' id='LC2644'>Well, it took my mind off from everything else; took it clear off,</div><div class='line' id='LC2645'>and centered it in my helmet; and mile after mile, there it stayed,</div><div class='line' id='LC2646'>imagining the handkerchief, picturing the handkerchief; and it</div><div class='line' id='LC2647'>was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling</div><div class='line' id='LC2648'>down into my eyes, and I couldn&#39;t get at it.  It seems like a little</div><div class='line' id='LC2649'>thing, on paper, but it was not a little thing at all; it was</div><div class='line' id='LC2650'>the most real kind of misery.  I would not say it if it was not so.</div><div class='line' id='LC2651'>I made up my mind that I would carry along a reticule next time,</div><div class='line' id='LC2652'>let it look how it might, and people say what they would.  Of course</div><div class='line' id='LC2653'>these iron dudes of the Round Table would think it was scandalous,</div><div class='line' id='LC2654'>and maybe raise Sheol about it, but as for me, give me comfort</div><div class='line' id='LC2655'>first, and style afterwards.  So we jogged along, and now and then</div><div class='line' id='LC2656'>we struck a stretch of dust, and it would tumble up in clouds and</div><div class='line' id='LC2657'>get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and of course I said</div><div class='line' id='LC2658'>things I oughtn&#39;t to have said, I don&#39;t deny that.  I am not</div><div class='line' id='LC2659'>better than others.</div><div class='line' id='LC2660'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2661'>We couldn&#39;t seem to meet anybody in this lonesome Britain, not</div><div class='line' id='LC2662'>even an ogre; and, in the mood I was in then, it was well for</div><div class='line' id='LC2663'>the ogre; that is, an ogre with a handkerchief.  Most knights</div><div class='line' id='LC2664'>would have thought of nothing but getting his armor; but so I got</div><div class='line' id='LC2665'>his bandanna, he could keep his hardware, for all of me.</div><div class='line' id='LC2666'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2667'>Meantime, it was getting hotter and hotter in there.  You see,</div><div class='line' id='LC2668'>the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more</div><div class='line' id='LC2669'>all the time.  Well, when you are hot, that way, every little thing</div><div class='line' id='LC2670'>irritates you.  When I trotted, I rattled like a crate of dishes,</div><div class='line' id='LC2671'>and that annoyed me; and moreover I couldn&#39;t seem to stand that</div><div class='line' id='LC2672'>shield slatting and banging, now about my breast, now around my</div><div class='line' id='LC2673'>back; and if I dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched</div><div class='line' id='LC2674'>in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does, and as we didn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC2675'>create any breeze at that gait, I was like to get fried in that</div><div class='line' id='LC2676'>stove; and besides, the quieter you went the heavier the iron</div><div class='line' id='LC2677'>settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh</div><div class='line' id='LC2678'>every minute.  And you had to be always changing hands, and passing</div><div class='line' id='LC2679'>your spear over to the other foot, it got so irksome for one hand</div><div class='line' id='LC2680'>to hold it long at a time.</div><div class='line' id='LC2681'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2682'>Well, you know, when you perspire that way, in rivers, there comes</div><div class='line' id='LC2683'>a time when you--when you--well, when you itch.  You are inside,</div><div class='line' id='LC2684'>your hands are outside; so there you are; nothing but iron between.</div><div class='line' id='LC2685'>It is not a light thing, let it sound as it may.  First it is one</div><div class='line' id='LC2686'>place; then another; then some more; and it goes on spreading and</div><div class='line' id='LC2687'>spreading, and at last the territory is all occupied, and nobody</div><div class='line' id='LC2688'>can imagine what you feel like, nor how unpleasant it is.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC2689'>when it had got to the worst, and it seemed to me that I could</div><div class='line' id='LC2690'>not stand anything more, a fly got in through the bars and settled</div><div class='line' id='LC2691'>on my nose, and the bars were stuck and wouldn&#39;t work, and I</div><div class='line' id='LC2692'>couldn&#39;t get the visor up; and I could only shake my head, which</div><div class='line' id='LC2693'>was baking hot by this time, and the fly--well, you know how a fly</div><div class='line' id='LC2694'>acts when he has got a certainty--he only minded the shaking enough</div><div class='line' id='LC2695'>to change from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzz</div><div class='line' id='LC2696'>all around in there, and keep on lighting and biting, in a way</div><div class='line' id='LC2697'>that a person, already so distressed as I was, simply could not</div><div class='line' id='LC2698'>stand.  So I gave in, and got Alisande to unship the helmet and</div><div class='line' id='LC2699'>relieve me of it.  Then she emptied the conveniences out of it</div><div class='line' id='LC2700'>and fetched it full of water, and I drank and then stood up, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2701'>she poured the rest down inside the armor. One cannot think how</div><div class='line' id='LC2702'>refreshing it was.  She continued to fetch and pour until I was</div><div class='line' id='LC2703'>well soaked and thoroughly comfortable.</div><div class='line' id='LC2704'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2705'>It was good to have a rest--and peace.  But nothing is quite</div><div class='line' id='LC2706'>perfect in this life, at any time.  I had made a pipe a while back,</div><div class='line' id='LC2707'>and also some pretty fair tobacco; not the real thing, but what</div><div class='line' id='LC2708'>some of the Indians use: the inside bark of the willow, dried.</div><div class='line' id='LC2709'>These comforts had been in the helmet, and now I had them again,</div><div class='line' id='LC2710'>but no matches.</div><div class='line' id='LC2711'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2712'>Gradually, as the time wore along, one annoying fact was borne in</div><div class='line' id='LC2713'>upon my understanding--that we were weather-bound.  An armed novice</div><div class='line' id='LC2714'>cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it.  Sandy was</div><div class='line' id='LC2715'>not enough; not enough for me, anyway.  We had to wait until</div><div class='line' id='LC2716'>somebody should come along.  Waiting, in silence, would have been</div><div class='line' id='LC2717'>agreeable enough, for I was full of matter for reflection, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2718'>wanted to give it a chance to work.  I wanted to try and think out</div><div class='line' id='LC2719'>how it was that rational or even half-rational men could ever</div><div class='line' id='LC2720'>have learned to wear armor, considering its inconveniences; and</div><div class='line' id='LC2721'>how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations</div><div class='line' id='LC2722'>when it was plain that what I had suffered to-day they had had</div><div class='line' id='LC2723'>to suffer all the days of their lives.  I wanted to think that out;</div><div class='line' id='LC2724'>and moreover I wanted to think out some way to reform this evil</div><div class='line' id='LC2725'>and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out; but</div><div class='line' id='LC2726'>thinking was out of the question in the circumstances.  You couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC2727'>think, where Sandy was.</div><div class='line' id='LC2728'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2729'>She was a quite biddable creature and good-hearted, but she had</div><div class='line' id='LC2730'>a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill, and made your head</div><div class='line' id='LC2731'>sore like the drays and wagons in a city.  If she had had a cork</div><div class='line' id='LC2732'>she would have been a comfort.  But you can&#39;t cork that kind;</div><div class='line' id='LC2733'>they would die.  Her clack was going all day, and you would think</div><div class='line' id='LC2734'>something would surely happen to her works, by and by; but no,</div><div class='line' id='LC2735'>they never got out of order; and she never had to slack up for</div><div class='line' id='LC2736'>words.  She could grind, and pump, and churn, and buzz by the week,</div><div class='line' id='LC2737'>and never stop to oil up or blow out.  And yet the result was just</div><div class='line' id='LC2738'>nothing but wind.  She never had any ideas, any more than a fog</div><div class='line' id='LC2739'>has.  She was a perfect blatherskite; I mean for jaw, jaw, jaw,</div><div class='line' id='LC2740'>talk, talk, talk, jabber, jabber, jabber; but just as good as she</div><div class='line' id='LC2741'>could be.  I hadn&#39;t minded her mill that morning, on account of</div><div class='line' id='LC2742'>having that hornets&#39; nest of other troubles; but more than once</div><div class='line' id='LC2743'>in the afternoon I had to say:</div><div class='line' id='LC2744'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2745'>&quot;Take a rest, child; the way you are using up all the domestic air,</div><div class='line' id='LC2746'>the kingdom will have to go to importing it by to-morrow, and it&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC2747'>a low enough treasury without that.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC2748'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2749'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2750'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2751'>CHAPTER XIII</div><div class='line' id='LC2752'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2753'>FREEMEN</div><div class='line' id='LC2754'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2755'>Yes, it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be</div><div class='line' id='LC2756'>contented.  Only a little while back, when I was riding and</div><div class='line' id='LC2757'>suffering, what a heaven this peace, this rest, this sweet serenity</div><div class='line' id='LC2758'>in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have</div><div class='line' id='LC2759'>seemed, where I could keep perfectly comfortable all the time</div><div class='line' id='LC2760'>by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then; yet</div><div class='line' id='LC2761'>already I was getting dissatisfied; partly because I could not</div><div class='line' id='LC2762'>light my pipe--for, although I had long ago started a match factory,</div><div class='line' id='LC2763'>I had forgotten to bring matches with me--and partly because we</div><div class='line' id='LC2764'>had nothing to eat.  Here was another illustration of the childlike</div><div class='line' id='LC2765'>improvidence of this age and people.  A man in armor always trusted</div><div class='line' id='LC2766'>to chance for his food on a journey, and would have been scandalized</div><div class='line' id='LC2767'>at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear.  There</div><div class='line' id='LC2768'>was probably not a knight of all the Round Table combination who</div><div class='line' id='LC2769'>would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing</div><div class='line' id='LC2770'>as that on his flagstaff.  And yet there could not be anything more</div><div class='line' id='LC2771'>sensible.  It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches</div><div class='line' id='LC2772'>into my helmet, but I was interrupted in the act, and had to make</div><div class='line' id='LC2773'>an excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them.</div><div class='line' id='LC2774'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2775'>Night approached, and with it a storm.  The darkness came on fast.</div><div class='line' id='LC2776'>We must camp, of course.  I found a good shelter for the demoiselle</div><div class='line' id='LC2777'>under a rock, and went off and found another for myself.  But</div><div class='line' id='LC2778'>I was obliged to remain in my armor, because I could not get it off</div><div class='line' id='LC2779'>by myself and yet could not allow Alisande to help, because it</div><div class='line' id='LC2780'>would have seemed so like undressing before folk.  It would not</div><div class='line' id='LC2781'>have amounted to that in reality, because I had clothes on</div><div class='line' id='LC2782'>underneath; but the prejudices of one&#39;s breeding are not gotten</div><div class='line' id='LC2783'>rid of just at a jump, and I knew that when it came to stripping</div><div class='line' id='LC2784'>off that bob-tailed iron petticoat I should be embarrassed.</div><div class='line' id='LC2785'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2786'>With the storm came a change of weather; and the stronger the wind</div><div class='line' id='LC2787'>blew, and the wilder the rain lashed around, the colder and colder</div><div class='line' id='LC2788'>it got.  Pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants and worms</div><div class='line' id='LC2789'>and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside</div><div class='line' id='LC2790'>my armor to get warm; and while some of them behaved well enough,</div><div class='line' id='LC2791'>and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet, the majority</div><div class='line' id='LC2792'>were of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still,</div><div class='line' id='LC2793'>but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what;</div><div class='line' id='LC2794'>especially the ants, which went tickling along in wearisome</div><div class='line' id='LC2795'>procession from one end of me to the other by the hour, and are</div><div class='line' id='LC2796'>a kind of creatures which I never wish to sleep with again.</div><div class='line' id='LC2797'>It would be my advice to persons situated in this way, to not roll</div><div class='line' id='LC2798'>or thrash around, because this excites the interest of all the</div><div class='line' id='LC2799'>different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want</div><div class='line' id='LC2800'>to turn out and see what is going on, and this makes things worse</div><div class='line' id='LC2801'>than they were before, and of course makes you objurgate harder,</div><div class='line' id='LC2802'>too, if you can.  Still, if one did not roll and thrash around</div><div class='line' id='LC2803'>he would die; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other;</div><div class='line' id='LC2804'>there is no real choice.  Even after I was frozen solid I could</div><div class='line' id='LC2805'>still distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he is</div><div class='line' id='LC2806'>taking electric treatment.  I said I would never wear armor</div><div class='line' id='LC2807'>after this trip.</div><div class='line' id='LC2808'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2809'>All those trying hours whilst I was frozen and yet was in a living</div><div class='line' id='LC2810'>fire, as you may say, on account of that swarm of crawlers, that</div><div class='line' id='LC2811'>same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my</div><div class='line' id='LC2812'>tired head: How do people stand this miserable armor?  How have</div><div class='line' id='LC2813'>they managed to stand it all these generations?  How can they sleep</div><div class='line' id='LC2814'>at night for dreading the tortures of next day?</div><div class='line' id='LC2815'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2816'>When the morning came at last, I was in a bad enough plight: seedy,</div><div class='line' id='LC2817'>drowsy, fagged, from want of sleep; weary from thrashing around,</div><div class='line' id='LC2818'>famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to get rid of</div><div class='line' id='LC2819'>the animals; and crippled with rheumatism.  And how had it fared</div><div class='line' id='LC2820'>with the nobly born, the titled aristocrat, the Demoiselle Alisande</div><div class='line' id='LC2821'>la Carteloise?  Why, she was as fresh as a squirrel; she had slept</div><div class='line' id='LC2822'>like the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor any</div><div class='line' id='LC2823'>other noble in the land had ever had one, and so she was not</div><div class='line' id='LC2824'>missing it.  Measured by modern standards, they were merely modified</div><div class='line' id='LC2825'>savages, those people.  This noble lady showed no impatience to get</div><div class='line' id='LC2826'>to breakfast--and that smacks of the savage, too.  On their journeys</div><div class='line' id='LC2827'>those Britons were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them;</div><div class='line' id='LC2828'>and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting,</div><div class='line' id='LC2829'>after the style of the Indian and the anaconda.  As like as not,</div><div class='line' id='LC2830'>Sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch.</div><div class='line' id='LC2831'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2832'>We were off before sunrise, Sandy riding and I limping along</div><div class='line' id='LC2833'>behind.  In half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor</div><div class='line' id='LC2834'>creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded</div><div class='line' id='LC2835'>as a road.  They were as humble as animals to me; and when I</div><div class='line' id='LC2836'>proposed to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, so</div><div class='line' id='LC2837'>overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that</div><div class='line' id='LC2838'>at first they were not able to believe that I was in earnest.</div><div class='line' id='LC2839'>My lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side; she said</div><div class='line' id='LC2840'>in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the</div><div class='line' id='LC2841'>other cattle--a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely</div><div class='line' id='LC2842'>because it referred to them, and not because it insulted or offended</div><div class='line' id='LC2843'>them, for it didn&#39;t.  And yet they were not slaves, not chattels.</div><div class='line' id='LC2844'>By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen.  Seven-tenths</div><div class='line' id='LC2845'>of the free population of the country were of just their class and</div><div class='line' id='LC2846'>degree: small &quot;independent&quot; farmers, artisans, etc.; which is</div><div class='line' id='LC2847'>to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they were about</div><div class='line' id='LC2848'>all of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really respect-worthy,</div><div class='line' id='LC2849'>and to subtract them would have been to subtract the Nation and</div><div class='line' id='LC2850'>leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of a king,</div><div class='line' id='LC2851'>nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly with</div><div class='line' id='LC2852'>the arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of use or value</div><div class='line' id='LC2853'>in any rationally constructed world.  And yet, by ingenious</div><div class='line' id='LC2854'>contrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in the tail</div><div class='line' id='LC2855'>of the procession where it belonged, was marching head up and</div><div class='line' id='LC2856'>banners flying, at the other end of it; had elected itself to be</div><div class='line' id='LC2857'>the Nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long</div><div class='line' id='LC2858'>that they had come at last to accept it as a truth; and not only</div><div class='line' id='LC2859'>that, but to believe it right and as it should be.  The priests</div><div class='line' id='LC2860'>had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state</div><div class='line' id='LC2861'>of things was ordained of God; and so, not reflecting upon how</div><div class='line' id='LC2862'>unlike God it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms, and especially</div><div class='line' id='LC2863'>such poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matter</div><div class='line' id='LC2864'>there and become respectfully quiet.</div><div class='line' id='LC2865'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2866'>The talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in</div><div class='line' id='LC2867'>a formerly American ear.  They were freemen, but they could not</div><div class='line' id='LC2868'>leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his</div><div class='line' id='LC2869'>permission; they could not prepare their own bread, but must have</div><div class='line' id='LC2870'>their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery,</div><div class='line' id='LC2871'>and pay roundly for the same; they could not sell a piece of their</div><div class='line' id='LC2872'>own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the</div><div class='line' id='LC2873'>proceeds, nor buy a piece of somebody else&#39;s without remembering</div><div class='line' id='LC2874'>him in cash for the privilege; they had to harvest his grain for him</div><div class='line' id='LC2875'>gratis, and be ready to come at a moment&#39;s notice, leaving their</div><div class='line' id='LC2876'>own crop to destruction by the threatened storm; they had to let</div><div class='line' id='LC2877'>him plant fruit trees in their fields, and then keep their indignation</div><div class='line' id='LC2878'>to themselves when his heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the grain</div><div class='line' id='LC2879'>around the trees; they had to smother their anger when his hunting</div><div class='line' id='LC2880'>parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of</div><div class='line' id='LC2881'>their patient toil; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves,</div><div class='line' id='LC2882'>and when the swarms from my lord&#39;s dovecote settled on their crops</div><div class='line' id='LC2883'>they must not lose their temper and kill a bird, for awful would</div><div class='line' id='LC2884'>the penalty be; when the harvest was at last gathered, then came</div><div class='line' id='LC2885'>the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it: first</div><div class='line' id='LC2886'>the Church carted off its fat tenth, then the king&#39;s commissioner</div><div class='line' id='LC2887'>took his twentieth, then my lord&#39;s people made a mighty inroad</div><div class='line' id='LC2888'>upon the remainder; after which, the skinned freeman had liberty</div><div class='line' id='LC2889'>to bestow the remnant in his barn, in case it was worth the trouble;</div><div class='line' id='LC2890'>there were taxes, and taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxes</div><div class='line' id='LC2891'>again, and yet other taxes--upon this free and independent pauper,</div><div class='line' id='LC2892'>but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop, none upon the</div><div class='line' id='LC2893'>wasteful nobility or the all-devouring Church; if the baron would</div><div class='line' id='LC2894'>sleep unvexed, the freeman must sit up all night after his day&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC2895'>work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet; if the freeman&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC2896'>daughter--but no, that last infamy of monarchical government is</div><div class='line' id='LC2897'>unprintable; and finally, if the freeman, grown desperate with his</div><div class='line' id='LC2898'>tortures, found his life unendurable under such conditions, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2899'>sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge, the gentle</div><div class='line' id='LC2900'>Church condemned him to eternal fire, the gentle law buried him</div><div class='line' id='LC2901'>at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back,</div><div class='line' id='LC2902'>and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property</div><div class='line' id='LC2903'>and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors.</div><div class='line' id='LC2904'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2905'>And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work</div><div class='line' id='LC2906'>on their lord the bishop&#39;s road three days each--gratis; every</div><div class='line' id='LC2907'>head of a family, and every son of a family, three days each,</div><div class='line' id='LC2908'>gratis, and a day or so added for their servants.  Why, it was</div><div class='line' id='LC2909'>like reading about France and the French, before the ever memorable</div><div class='line' id='LC2910'>and blessed Revolution, which swept a thousand years of such</div><div class='line' id='LC2911'>villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood--one: a settlement</div><div class='line' id='LC2912'>of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for</div><div class='line' id='LC2913'>each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of</div><div class='line' id='LC2914'>that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and</div><div class='line' id='LC2915'>shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell.</div><div class='line' id='LC2916'>There were two &quot;Reigns of Terror,&quot; if we would but remember it</div><div class='line' id='LC2917'>and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other</div><div class='line' id='LC2918'>in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had</div><div class='line' id='LC2919'>lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand</div><div class='line' id='LC2920'>persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are</div><div class='line' id='LC2921'>all for the &quot;horrors&quot; of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror,</div><div class='line' id='LC2922'>so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe,</div><div class='line' id='LC2923'>compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty,</div><div class='line' id='LC2924'>and heart-break?  What is swift death by lightning compared with</div><div class='line' id='LC2925'>death by slow fire at the stake?  A city cemetery could contain the</div><div class='line' id='LC2926'>coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so</div><div class='line' id='LC2927'>diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could</div><div class='line' id='LC2928'>hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror</div><div class='line' id='LC2929'>--that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has</div><div class='line' id='LC2930'>been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.</div><div class='line' id='LC2931'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2932'>These poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast</div><div class='line' id='LC2933'>and their talk with me, were as full of humble reverence for their</div><div class='line' id='LC2934'>king and Church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire.</div><div class='line' id='LC2935'>There was something pitifully ludicrous about it.  I asked them</div><div class='line' id='LC2936'>if they supposed a nation of people ever existed, who, with a free</div><div class='line' id='LC2937'>vote in every man&#39;s hand, would elect that a single family and its</div><div class='line' id='LC2938'>descendants should reign over it forever, whether gifted or boobies,</div><div class='line' id='LC2939'>to the exclusion of all other families--including the voter&#39;s; and</div><div class='line' id='LC2940'>would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised</div><div class='line' id='LC2941'>to dizzy summits of rank, and clothed on with offensive transmissible</div><div class='line' id='LC2942'>glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nation&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC2943'>families--_including his own_.</div><div class='line' id='LC2944'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2945'>They all looked unhit, and said they didn&#39;t know; that they had</div><div class='line' id='LC2946'>never thought about it before, and it hadn&#39;t ever occurred to them</div><div class='line' id='LC2947'>that a nation could be so situated that every man _could_ have</div><div class='line' id='LC2948'>a say in the government.  I said I had seen one--and that it would</div><div class='line' id='LC2949'>last until it had an Established Church.  Again they were all</div><div class='line' id='LC2950'>unhit--at first.  But presently one man looked up and asked me</div><div class='line' id='LC2951'>to state that proposition again; and state it slowly, so it could</div><div class='line' id='LC2952'>soak into his understanding.  I did it; and after a little he had</div><div class='line' id='LC2953'>the idea, and he brought his fist down and said _he_ didn&#39;t believe</div><div class='line' id='LC2954'>a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down</div><div class='line' id='LC2955'>in the mud and dirt in any such way; and that to steal from a nation</div><div class='line' id='LC2956'>its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes.</div><div class='line' id='LC2957'>I said to myself:</div><div class='line' id='LC2958'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2959'>&quot;This one&#39;s a man.  If I were backed by enough of his sort, I would</div><div class='line' id='LC2960'>make a strike for the welfare of this country, and try to prove</div><div class='line' id='LC2961'>myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its</div><div class='line' id='LC2962'>system of government.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC2963'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2964'>You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one&#39;s country, not to</div><div class='line' id='LC2965'>its institutions or its office-holders.  The country is the real</div><div class='line' id='LC2966'>thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing</div><div class='line' id='LC2967'>to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are</div><div class='line' id='LC2968'>extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out,</div><div class='line' id='LC2969'>become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body</div><div class='line' id='LC2970'>from winter, disease, and death.  To be loyal to rags, to shout</div><div class='line' id='LC2971'>for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags--that is a loyalty</div><div class='line' id='LC2972'>of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented</div><div class='line' id='LC2973'>by monarchy; let monarchy keep it.  I was from Connecticut, whose</div><div class='line' id='LC2974'>Constitution declares &quot;that all political power is inherent in</div><div class='line' id='LC2975'>the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority</div><div class='line' id='LC2976'>and instituted for their benefit; and that they have _at all times_</div><div class='line' id='LC2977'>an undeniable and indefeasible right to _alter their form of</div><div class='line' id='LC2978'>government_ in such a manner as they may think expedient.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC2979'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2980'>Under that gospel, the citizen who thinks he sees that the</div><div class='line' id='LC2981'>commonwealth&#39;s political clothes are worn out, and yet holds his</div><div class='line' id='LC2982'>peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he is</div><div class='line' id='LC2983'>a traitor.  That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this</div><div class='line' id='LC2984'>decay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate anyway, and</div><div class='line' id='LC2985'>it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see</div><div class='line' id='LC2986'>the matter as he does.</div><div class='line' id='LC2987'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC2988'>And now here I was, in a country where a right to say how the</div><div class='line' id='LC2989'>country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each</div><div class='line' id='LC2990'>thousand of its population.  For the nine hundred and ninety-four</div><div class='line' id='LC2991'>to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose</div><div class='line' id='LC2992'>to change it, would have made the whole six shudder as one man,</div><div class='line' id='LC2993'>it would have been so disloyal, so dishonorable, such putrid black</div><div class='line' id='LC2994'>treason.  So to speak, I was become a stockholder in a corporation</div><div class='line' id='LC2995'>where nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all</div><div class='line' id='LC2996'>the money and did all the work, and the other six elected themselves</div><div class='line' id='LC2997'>a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends.  It seemed</div><div class='line' id='LC2998'>to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed was</div><div class='line' id='LC2999'>a new deal.  The thing that would have best suited the circus side</div><div class='line' id='LC3000'>of my nature would have been to resign the Boss-ship and get up</div><div class='line' id='LC3001'>an insurrection and turn it into a revolution; but I knew that the</div><div class='line' id='LC3002'>Jack Cade or the Wat Tyler who tries such a thing without first</div><div class='line' id='LC3003'>educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely</div><div class='line' id='LC3004'>certain to get left.  I had never been accustomed to getting left,</div><div class='line' id='LC3005'>even if I do say it myself.  Wherefore, the &quot;deal&quot; which had been</div><div class='line' id='LC3006'>for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different</div><div class='line' id='LC3007'>pattern from the Cade-Tyler sort.</div><div class='line' id='LC3008'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3009'>So I did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat</div><div class='line' id='LC3010'>munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human</div><div class='line' id='LC3011'>sheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him.</div><div class='line' id='LC3012'>After I had finished, I got him to lend me a little ink from his</div><div class='line' id='LC3013'>veins; and with this and a sliver I wrote on a piece of bark--</div><div class='line' id='LC3014'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3015'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put him in the Man-factory--</div><div class='line' id='LC3016'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3017'>and gave it to him, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3018'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3019'>&quot;Take it to the palace at Camelot and give it into the hands of</div><div class='line' id='LC3020'>Amyas le Poulet, whom I call Clarence, and he will understand.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3021'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3022'>&quot;He is a priest, then,&quot; said the man, and some of the enthusiasm</div><div class='line' id='LC3023'>went out of his face.</div><div class='line' id='LC3024'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3025'>&quot;How--a priest?

I spent money rather too freely in those days,</div><div class='line' id='LC3067'>it is true; but one reason for it was that I hadn&#39;t got the</div><div class='line' id='LC3068'>proportions of things entirely adjusted, even yet, after so long</div><div class='line' id='LC3069'>a sojourn in Britain--hadn&#39;t got along to where I was able to</div><div class='line' id='LC3070'>absolutely realize that a penny in Arthur&#39;s land and a couple of</div><div class='line' id='LC3071'>dollars in Connecticut were about one and the same thing: just</div><div class='line' id='LC3072'>twins, as you may say, in purchasing power.  If my start from</div><div class='line' id='LC3073'>Camelot could have been delayed a very few days I could have paid</div><div class='line' id='LC3074'>these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint, and that</div><div class='line' id='LC3075'>would have pleased me; and them, too, not less.  I had adopted</div><div class='line' id='LC3076'>the American values exclusively.  In a week or two now, cents,</div><div class='line' id='LC3077'>nickels, dimes, quarters, and half-dollars, and also a trifle of</div><div class='line' id='LC3078'>gold, would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through</div><div class='line' id='LC3079'>the commercial veins of the kingdom, and I looked to see this</div><div class='line' id='LC3080'>new blood freshen up its life.</div><div class='line' id='LC3081'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3082'>The farmers were bound to throw in something, to sort of offset</div><div class='line' id='LC3083'>my liberality, whether I would or no; so I let them give me a flint</div><div class='line' id='LC3084'>and steel; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed Sandy</div><div class='line' id='LC3085'>and me on our horse, I lit my pipe.  When the first blast of smoke</div><div class='line' id='LC3086'>shot out through the bars of my helmet, all those people broke</div><div class='line' id='LC3087'>for the woods, and Sandy went over backwards and struck the ground</div><div class='line' id='LC3088'>with a dull thud.  They thought I was one of those fire-belching</div><div class='line' id='LC3089'>dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other</div><div class='line' id='LC3090'>professional liars.  I had infinite trouble to persuade those people</div><div class='line' id='LC3091'>to venture back within explaining distance.  Then I told them that</div><div class='line' id='LC3092'>this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none</div><div class='line' id='LC3093'>but my enemies.  And I promised, with my hand on my heart, that</div><div class='line' id='LC3094'>if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass</div><div class='line' id='LC3095'>before me they should see that only those who remained behind would</div><div class='line' id='LC3096'>be struck dead.  The procession moved with a good deal of promptness.</div><div class='line' id='LC3097'>There were no casualties to report, for nobody had curiosity enough</div><div class='line' id='LC3098'>to remain behind to see what would happen.</div><div class='line' id='LC3099'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3100'>I lost some time, now, for these big children, their fears gone,</div><div class='line' id='LC3101'>became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling fireworks</div><div class='line' id='LC3102'>that I had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before</div><div class='line' id='LC3103'>they would let me go.  Still the delay was not wholly unproductive,</div><div class='line' id='LC3104'>for it took all that time to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new</div><div class='line' id='LC3105'>thing, she being so close to it, you know.  It plugged up her</div><div class='line' id='LC3106'>conversation mill, too, for a considerable while, and that was</div><div class='line' id='LC3107'>a gain.  But above all other benefits accruing, I had learned</div><div class='line' id='LC3108'>something.  I was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come</div><div class='line' id='LC3109'>along, now.</div><div class='line' id='LC3110'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3111'>We tarried with a holy hermit, that night, and my opportunity</div><div class='line' id='LC3112'>came about the middle of the next afternoon.  We were crossing</div><div class='line' id='LC3113'>a vast meadow by way of short-cut, and I was musing absently,</div><div class='line' id='LC3114'>hearing nothing, seeing nothing, when Sandy suddenly interrupted</div><div class='line' id='LC3115'>a remark which she had begun that morning, with the cry:</div><div class='line' id='LC3116'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3117'>&quot;Defend thee, lord!--peril of life is toward!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3118'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3119'>And she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood.</div><div class='line' id='LC3120'>I looked up and saw, far off in the shade of a tree, half a dozen</div><div class='line' id='LC3121'>armed knights and their squires; and straightway there was bustle</div><div class='line' id='LC3122'>among them and tightening of saddle-girths for the mount.  My pipe</div><div class='line' id='LC3123'>was ready and would have been lit, if I had not been lost in</div><div class='line' id='LC3124'>thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore</div><div class='line' id='LC3125'>to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging</div><div class='line' id='LC3126'>anybody.  I lit up at once, and by the time I had got a good head</div><div class='line' id='LC3127'>of reserved steam on, here they came.  All together, too; none of</div><div class='line' id='LC3128'>those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about</div><div class='line' id='LC3129'>--one courtly rascal at a time, and the rest standing by to see fair</div><div class='line' id='LC3130'>play.  No, they came in a body, they came with a whirr and a rush,</div><div class='line' id='LC3131'>they came like a volley from a battery; came with heads low down,</div><div class='line' id='LC3132'>plumes streaming out behind, lances advanced at a level.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC3133'>a handsome sight, a beautiful sight--for a man up a tree.  I laid</div><div class='line' id='LC3134'>my lance in rest and waited, with my heart beating, till the iron</div><div class='line' id='LC3135'>wave was just ready to break over me, then spouted a column of</div><div class='line' id='LC3136'>white smoke through the bars of my helmet.  You should have seen</div><div class='line' id='LC3137'>the wave go to pieces and scatter!  This was a finer sight than</div><div class='line' id='LC3138'>the other one.</div><div class='line' id='LC3139'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3140'>But these people stopped, two or three hundred yards away, and</div><div class='line' id='LC3141'>this troubled me.  My satisfaction collapsed, and fear came;</div><div class='line' id='LC3142'>I judged I was a lost man.  But Sandy was radiant; and was going</div><div class='line' id='LC3143'>to be eloquent--but I stopped her, and told her my magic had</div><div class='line' id='LC3144'>miscarried, somehow or other, and she must mount, with all despatch,</div><div class='line' id='LC3145'>and we must ride for life.  No, she wouldn&#39;t.  She said that my</div><div class='line' id='LC3146'>enchantment had disabled those knights; they were not riding on,</div><div class='line' id='LC3147'>because they couldn&#39;t; wait, they would drop out of their saddles</div><div class='line' id='LC3148'>presently, and we would get their horses and harness.  I could not</div><div class='line' id='LC3149'>deceive such trusting simplicity, so I said it was a mistake; that</div><div class='line' id='LC3150'>when my fireworks killed at all, they killed instantly; no, the men</div><div class='line' id='LC3151'>would not die, there was something wrong about my apparatus,</div><div class='line' id='LC3152'>I couldn&#39;t tell what; but we must hurry and get away, for those</div><div class='line' id='LC3153'>people would attack us again, in a minute.  Sandy laughed, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3154'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3155'>&quot;Lack-a-day, sir, they be not of that breed!  Sir Launcelot will</div><div class='line' id='LC3156'>give battle to dragons, and will abide by them, and will assail</div><div class='line' id='LC3157'>them again, and yet again, and still again, until he do conquer</div><div class='line' id='LC3158'>and destroy them; and so likewise will Sir Pellinore and Sir Aglovale</div><div class='line' id='LC3159'>and Sir Carados, and mayhap others, but there be none else that</div><div class='line' id='LC3160'>will venture it, let the idle say what the idle will.  And, la,</div><div class='line' id='LC3161'>as to yonder base rufflers, think ye they have not their fill,</div><div class='line' id='LC3162'>but yet desire more?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3163'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3164'>&quot;Well, then, what are they waiting for?  Why don&#39;t they leave?</div><div class='line' id='LC3165'>Nobody&#39;s hindering.  Good land, I&#39;m willing to let bygones be</div><div class='line' id='LC3166'>bygones, I&#39;m sure.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3167'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3168'>&quot;Leave, is it?  Oh, give thyself easement as to that.  They dream</div><div class='line' id='LC3169'>not of it, no, not they.  They wait to yield them.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3170'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3171'>&quot;Come--really, is that &#39;sooth&#39;--as you people say?  If they want to,</div><div class='line' id='LC3172'>why don&#39;t they?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3173'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3174'>&quot;It would like them much; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed,</div><div class='line' id='LC3175'>ye would not hold them blamable. They fear to come.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3176'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3177'>&quot;Well, then, suppose I go to them instead, and--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3178'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3179'>&quot;Ah, wit ye well they would not abide your coming.  I will go.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3180'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3181'>And she did.  She was a handy person to have along on a raid.</div><div class='line' id='LC3182'>I would have considered this a doubtful errand, myself.  I presently</div><div class='line' id='LC3183'>saw the knights riding away, and Sandy coming back.  That was</div><div class='line' id='LC3184'>a relief.  I judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings</div><div class='line' id='LC3185'>--I mean in the conversation; otherwise the interview wouldn&#39;t have</div><div class='line' id='LC3186'>been so short.  But it turned out that she had managed the business</div><div class='line' id='LC3187'>well; in fact, admirably.  She said that when she told those people</div><div class='line' id='LC3188'>I was The Boss, it hit them where they lived: &quot;smote them sore</div><div class='line' id='LC3189'>with fear and dread&quot; was her word; and then they were ready to</div><div class='line' id='LC3190'>put up with anything she might require.  So she swore them to appear</div><div class='line' id='LC3191'>at Arthur&#39;s court within two days and yield them, with horse and</div><div class='line' id='LC3192'>harness, and be my knights henceforth, and subject to my command.</div><div class='line' id='LC3193'>How much better she managed that thing than I should have done</div><div class='line' id='LC3194'>it myself!  She was a daisy.</div><div class='line' id='LC3195'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3196'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3197'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3198'>CHAPTER XV</div><div class='line' id='LC3199'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3200'>SANDY&#39;S TALE</div><div class='line' id='LC3201'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3202'>&quot;And so I&#39;m proprietor of some knights,&quot; said I, as we rode off.</div><div class='line' id='LC3203'>&quot;Who would ever have supposed that I should live to list up assets</div><div class='line' id='LC3204'>of that sort.  I shan&#39;t know what to do with them; unless I raffle</div><div class='line' id='LC3205'>them off.  How many of them are there, Sandy?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3206'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3207'>&quot;Seven, please you, sir, and their squires.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3208'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3209'>&quot;It is a good haul.

That will I tell eftsoons.&quot;  Then she</div><div class='line' id='LC3216'>said musingly, and softly, turning the words daintily over her</div><div class='line' id='LC3217'>tongue: &quot;Hang they out--hang they out--where hang--where do they</div><div class='line' id='LC3218'>hang out; eh, right so; where do they hang out.  Of a truth the</div><div class='line' id='LC3219'>phrase hath a fair and winsome grace, and is prettily worded</div><div class='line' id='LC3220'>withal.  I will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse, whereby</div><div class='line' id='LC3221'>I may peradventure learn it.  Where do they hang out.  Even so!</div><div class='line' id='LC3222'>already it falleth trippingly from my tongue, and forasmuch as--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3223'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3224'>&quot;Don&#39;t forget the cowboys, Sandy.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3225'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3226'>&quot;Cowboys?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3227'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3228'>&quot;Yes; the knights, you know: You were going to tell me about them.</div><div class='line' id='LC3229'>A while back, you remember.

Tell me about the knights.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3236'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3237'>&quot;I will well, and lightly will begin.  So they two departed and</div><div class='line' id='LC3238'>rode into a great forest.  And--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3239'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3240'>&quot;Great Scott!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3241'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3242'>You see, I recognized my mistake at once.  I had set her works</div><div class='line' id='LC3243'>a-going; it was my own fault; she would be thirty days getting down</div><div class='line' id='LC3244'>to those facts.  And she generally began without a preface and</div><div class='line' id='LC3245'>finished without a result.  If you interrupted her she would either</div><div class='line' id='LC3246'>go right along without noticing, or answer with a couple of words,</div><div class='line' id='LC3247'>and go back and say the sentence over again.  So, interruptions</div><div class='line' id='LC3248'>only did harm; and yet I had to interrupt, and interrupt pretty</div><div class='line' id='LC3249'>frequently, too, in order to save my life; a person would die if</div><div class='line' id='LC3250'>he let her monotony drip on him right along all day.</div><div class='line' id='LC3251'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3252'>&quot;Great Scott!&quot; I said in my distress.

So on the morn they heard their masses</div><div class='line' id='LC3261'>in the abbey, and so they rode forth till they came to a great</div><div class='line' id='LC3262'>forest; then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret, of</div><div class='line' id='LC3263'>twelve fair damsels, and two knights armed on great horses, and</div><div class='line' id='LC3264'>the damsels went to and fro by a tree.  And then was Sir Gawaine</div><div class='line' id='LC3265'>ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as the</div><div class='line' id='LC3266'>damsels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon</div><div class='line' id='LC3267'>the shield--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3268'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3269'>&quot;Now, if I hadn&#39;t seen the like myself in this country, Sandy,</div><div class='line' id='LC3270'>I wouldn&#39;t believe it.

But it isn&#39;t any matter.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3329'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3330'>&quot;--for I saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were</div><div class='line' id='LC3331'>gathered, and that time there might no man withstand him.

And therewith they took off their helms and</div><div class='line' id='LC3443'>either kissed other, and there they swore together either to love</div><div class='line' id='LC3444'>other as brethren--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3445'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3446'>But I lost the thread there, and dozed off to slumber, thinking</div><div class='line' id='LC3447'>about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength</div><div class='line' id='LC3448'>--strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome</div><div class='line' id='LC3449'>iron and drenched with perspiration, and hack and batter and bang</div><div class='line' id='LC3450'>each other for six hours on a stretch--should not have been born</div><div class='line' id='LC3451'>at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose.

It is a mixture that is always ineffectual, and should</div><div class='line' id='LC3456'>never have been attempted in the first place.  And yet, once you</div><div class='line' id='LC3457'>start a mistake, the trouble is done and you never know what is</div><div class='line' id='LC3458'>going to come of it.</div><div class='line' id='LC3459'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3460'>When I came to myself again and began to listen, I perceived that</div><div class='line' id='LC3461'>I had lost another chapter, and that Alisande had wandered a long</div><div class='line' id='LC3462'>way off with her people.</div><div class='line' id='LC3463'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3464'>&quot;And so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones,</div><div class='line' id='LC3465'>and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was</div><div class='line' id='LC3466'>the head of the stream, a fair fountain, and three damsels sitting</div><div class='line' id='LC3467'>thereby. In this country, said Sir Marhaus, came never knight</div><div class='line' id='LC3468'>since it was christened, but he found strange adventures--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3469'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3470'>&quot;This is not good form, Alisande.

Now after making this allowance, the truth remained</div><div class='line' id='LC3548'>that if I could find out something about a castle before ringing</div><div class='line' id='LC3549'>the door-bell--I mean hailing the warders--it was the sensible</div><div class='line' id='LC3550'>thing to do.  So I was pleased when I saw in the distance a horseman</div><div class='line' id='LC3551'>making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle.</div><div class='line' id='LC3552'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3553'>As we approached each other, I saw that he wore a plumed helmet,</div><div class='line' id='LC3554'>and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel, but bore a curious</div><div class='line' id='LC3555'>addition also--a stiff square garment like a herald&#39;s tabard.</div><div class='line' id='LC3556'>However, I had to smile at my own forgetfulness when I got nearer</div><div class='line' id='LC3557'>and read this sign on his tabard:</div><div class='line' id='LC3558'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3559'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Persimmon&#39;s Soap -- All the Prime-Donna Use It.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3560'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3561'>That was a little idea of my own, and had several wholesome purposes</div><div class='line' id='LC3562'>in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation.  In the</div><div class='line' id='LC3563'>first place, it was a furtive, underhand blow at this nonsense</div><div class='line' id='LC3564'>of knight errantry, though nobody suspected that but me.  I had</div><div class='line' id='LC3565'>started a number of these people out--the bravest knights I could</div><div class='line' id='LC3566'>get--each sandwiched between bulletin-boards bearing one device</div><div class='line' id='LC3567'>or another, and I judged that by and by when they got to be numerous</div><div class='line' id='LC3568'>enough they would begin to look ridiculous; and then, even the</div><div class='line' id='LC3569'>steel-clad ass that _hadn&#39;t_ any board would himself begin to look</div><div class='line' id='LC3570'>ridiculous because he was out of the fashion.</div><div class='line' id='LC3571'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3572'>Secondly, these missionaries would gradually, and without creating</div><div class='line' id='LC3573'>suspicion or exciting alarm, introduce a rudimentary cleanliness</div><div class='line' id='LC3574'>among the nobility, and from them it would work down to the people,</div><div class='line' id='LC3575'>if the priests could be kept quiet.  This would undermine the Church.</div><div class='line' id='LC3576'>I mean would be a step toward that.  Next, education--next, freedom</div><div class='line' id='LC3577'>--and then she would begin to crumble.  It being my conviction that</div><div class='line' id='LC3578'>any Established Church is an established crime, an established</div><div class='line' id='LC3579'>slave-pen, I had no scruples, but was willing to assail it in</div><div class='line' id='LC3580'>any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it.  Why, in my</div><div class='line' id='LC3581'>own former day--in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb</div><div class='line' id='LC3582'>of time--there were old Englishmen who imagined that they had been</div><div class='line' id='LC3583'>born in a free country: a &quot;free&quot; country with the Corporation Act</div><div class='line' id='LC3584'>and the Test still in force in it--timbers propped against men&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC3585'>liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an Established</div><div class='line' id='LC3586'>Anachronism with.</div><div class='line' id='LC3587'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3588'>My missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their</div><div class='line' id='LC3589'>tabards--the showy gilding was a neat idea, I could have got the</div><div class='line' id='LC3590'>king to wear a bulletin-board for the sake of that barbaric</div><div class='line' id='LC3591'>splendor--they were to spell out these signs and then explain to</div><div class='line' id='LC3592'>the lords and ladies what soap was; and if the lords and ladies</div><div class='line' id='LC3593'>were afraid of it, get them to try it on a dog.  The missionary&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC3594'>next move was to get the family together and try it on himself;</div><div class='line' id='LC3595'>he was to stop at no experiment, however desperate, that could</div><div class='line' id='LC3596'>convince the nobility that soap was harmless; if any final doubt</div><div class='line' id='LC3597'>remained, he must catch a hermit--the woods were full of them;</div><div class='line' id='LC3598'>saints they called themselves, and saints they were believed to be.</div><div class='line' id='LC3599'>They were unspeakably holy, and worked miracles, and everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC3600'>stood in awe of them.  If a hermit could survive a wash, and that</div><div class='line' id='LC3601'>failed to convince a duke, give him up, let him alone.</div><div class='line' id='LC3602'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3603'>Whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road</div><div class='line' id='LC3604'>they washed him, and when he got well they swore him to go and</div><div class='line' id='LC3605'>get a bulletin-board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest</div><div class='line' id='LC3606'>of his days.  As a consequence the workers in the field were</div><div class='line' id='LC3607'>increasing by degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading.</div><div class='line' id='LC3608'>My soap factory felt the strain early.  At first I had only two</div><div class='line' id='LC3609'>hands; but before I had left home I was already employing fifteen,</div><div class='line' id='LC3610'>and running night and day; and the atmospheric result was getting</div><div class='line' id='LC3611'>so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping</div><div class='line' id='LC3612'>around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer,</div><div class='line' id='LC3613'>and Sir Launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up</div><div class='line' id='LC3614'>and down the roof and swear, although I told him it was worse up</div><div class='line' id='LC3615'>there than anywhere else, but he said he wanted plenty of air; and</div><div class='line' id='LC3616'>he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap</div><div class='line' id='LC3617'>factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house</div><div class='line' id='LC3618'>he would be damned if he wouldn&#39;t strangle him.  There were ladies</div><div class='line' id='LC3619'>present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would</div><div class='line' id='LC3620'>swear before children, if the wind was their way when the factory</div><div class='line' id='LC3621'>was going.</div><div class='line' id='LC3622'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3623'>This missionary knight&#39;s name was La Cote Male Taile, and he said</div><div class='line' id='LC3624'>that this castle was the abode of Morgan le Fay, sister of</div><div class='line' id='LC3625'>King Arthur, and wife of King Uriens, monarch of a realm about</div><div class='line' id='LC3626'>as big as the District of Columbia--you could stand in the middle</div><div class='line' id='LC3627'>of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom.  &quot;Kings&quot; and &quot;Kingdoms&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3628'>were as thick in Britain as they had been in little Palestine in</div><div class='line' id='LC3629'>Joshua&#39;s time, when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up</div><div class='line' id='LC3630'>because they couldn&#39;t stretch out without a passport.</div><div class='line' id='LC3631'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3632'>La Cote was much depressed, for he had scored here the worst</div><div class='line' id='LC3633'>failure of his campaign.  He had not worked off a cake; yet he had</div><div class='line' id='LC3634'>tried all the tricks of the trade, even to the washing of a hermit;</div><div class='line' id='LC3635'>but the hermit died.  This was, indeed, a bad failure, for this</div><div class='line' id='LC3636'>animal would now be dubbed a martyr, and would take his place</div><div class='line' id='LC3637'>among the saints of the Roman calendar.  Thus made he his moan,</div><div class='line' id='LC3638'>this poor Sir La Cote Male Taile, and sorrowed passing sore.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC3639'>so my heart bled for him, and I was moved to comfort and stay him.</div><div class='line' id='LC3640'>Wherefore I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3641'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3642'>&quot;Forbear to grieve, fair knight, for this is not a defeat.  We have</div><div class='line' id='LC3643'>brains, you and I; and for such as have brains there are no defeats,</div><div class='line' id='LC3644'>but only victories.  Observe how we will turn this seeming disaster</div><div class='line' id='LC3645'>into an advertisement; an advertisement for our soap; and the</div><div class='line' id='LC3646'>biggest one, to draw, that was ever thought of; an advertisement</div><div class='line' id='LC3647'>that will transform that Mount Washington defeat into a Matterhorn</div><div class='line' id='LC3648'>victory.  We will put on your bulletin-board, &#39;_Patronized by the</div><div class='line' id='LC3649'>elect_.&#39;  How does that strike you?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3650'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3651'>&quot;Verily, it is wonderly bethought!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3652'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3653'>&quot;Well, a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little</div><div class='line' id='LC3654'>one-line ad, it&#39;s a corker.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3655'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3656'>So the poor colporteur&#39;s griefs vanished away.  He was a brave</div><div class='line' id='LC3657'>fellow, and had done mighty feats of arms in his time.  His chief</div><div class='line' id='LC3658'>celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one</div><div class='line' id='LC3659'>of mine, which he had once made with a damsel named Maledisant,</div><div class='line' id='LC3660'>who was as handy with her tongue as was Sandy, though in a different</div><div class='line' id='LC3661'>way, for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult, whereas</div><div class='line' id='LC3662'>Sandy&#39;s music was of a kindlier sort.  I knew his story well, and so</div><div class='line' id='LC3663'>I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he</div><div class='line' id='LC3664'>bade me farewell.  He supposed I was having a bitter hard time of it.</div><div class='line' id='LC3665'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3666'>Sandy and I discussed his story, as we rode along, and she said</div><div class='line' id='LC3667'>that La Cote&#39;s bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that</div><div class='line' id='LC3668'>trip; for the king&#39;s fool had overthrown him on the first day,</div><div class='line' id='LC3669'>and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the</div><div class='line' id='LC3670'>conqueror, but Maledisant didn&#39;t do it; and also persisted afterward</div><div class='line' id='LC3671'>in sticking to him, after all his defeats.  But, said I, suppose</div><div class='line' id='LC3672'>the victor should decline to accept his spoil?  She said that that</div><div class='line' id='LC3673'>wouldn&#39;t answer--he must.  He couldn&#39;t decline; it wouldn&#39;t be</div><div class='line' id='LC3674'>regular.  I made a note of that.  If Sandy&#39;s music got to be too</div><div class='line' id='LC3675'>burdensome, some time, I would let a knight defeat me, on the chance</div><div class='line' id='LC3676'>that she would desert to him.</div><div class='line' id='LC3677'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3678'>In due time we were challenged by the warders, from the castle</div><div class='line' id='LC3679'>walls, and after a parley admitted.  I have nothing pleasant to</div><div class='line' id='LC3680'>tell about that visit.  But it was not a disappointment, for I knew</div><div class='line' id='LC3681'>Mrs. le Fay by reputation, and was not expecting anything pleasant.</div><div class='line' id='LC3682'>She was held in awe by the whole realm, for she had made everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC3683'>believe she was a great sorceress.  All her ways were wicked, all</div><div class='line' id='LC3684'>her instincts devilish.  She was loaded to the eyelids with cold</div><div class='line' id='LC3685'>malice.  All her history was black with crime; and among her crimes</div><div class='line' id='LC3686'>murder was common.  I was most curious to see her; as curious as</div><div class='line' id='LC3687'>I could have been to see Satan.  To my surprise she was beautiful;</div><div class='line' id='LC3688'>black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive, age</div><div class='line' id='LC3689'>had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness.</div><div class='line' id='LC3690'>She could have passed for old Uriens&#39; granddaughter, she could</div><div class='line' id='LC3691'>have been mistaken for sister to her own son.</div><div class='line' id='LC3692'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3693'>As soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered</div><div class='line' id='LC3694'>into her presence.  King Uriens was there, a kind-faced old man</div><div class='line' id='LC3695'>with a subdued look; and also the son, Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains,</div><div class='line' id='LC3696'>in whom I was, of course, interested on account of the tradition</div><div class='line' id='LC3697'>that he had once done battle with thirty knights, and also on</div><div class='line' id='LC3698'>account of his trip with Sir Gawaine and Sir Marhaus, which Sandy</div><div class='line' id='LC3699'>had been aging me with.  But Morgan was the main attraction, the</div><div class='line' id='LC3700'>conspicuous personality here; she was head chief of this household,</div><div class='line' id='LC3701'>that was plain.  She caused us to be seated, and then she began,</div><div class='line' id='LC3702'>with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses, to ask me</div><div class='line' id='LC3703'>questions.  Dear me, it was like a bird or a flute, or something,</div><div class='line' id='LC3704'>talking.  I felt persuaded that this woman must have been</div><div class='line' id='LC3705'>misrepresented, lied about.  She trilled along, and trilled along,</div><div class='line' id='LC3706'>and presently a handsome young page, clothed like the rainbow, and</div><div class='line' id='LC3707'>as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave, came with something</div><div class='line' id='LC3708'>on a golden salver, and, kneeling to present it to her, overdid</div><div class='line' id='LC3709'>his graces and lost his balance, and so fell lightly against her</div><div class='line' id='LC3710'>knee.  She slipped a dirk into him in as matter-of-course a way as</div><div class='line' id='LC3711'>another person would have harpooned a rat!</div><div class='line' id='LC3712'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3713'>Poor child! he slumped to the floor, twisted his silken limbs in</div><div class='line' id='LC3714'>one great straining contortion of pain, and was dead.  Out of the</div><div class='line' id='LC3715'>old king was wrung an involuntary &quot;O-h!&quot; of compassion.  The look</div><div class='line' id='LC3716'>he got, made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens</div><div class='line' id='LC3717'>in it.  Sir Uwaine, at a sign from his mother, went to the anteroom</div><div class='line' id='LC3718'>and called some servants, and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly</div><div class='line' id='LC3719'>along with her talk.</div><div class='line' id='LC3720'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3721'>I saw that she was a good housekeeper, for while she talked she</div><div class='line' id='LC3722'>kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made</div><div class='line' id='LC3723'>no balks in handling the body and getting it out; when they came</div><div class='line' id='LC3724'>with fresh clean towels, she sent back for the other kind; and</div><div class='line' id='LC3725'>when they had finished wiping the floor and were going, she indicated</div><div class='line' id='LC3726'>a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had</div><div class='line' id='LC3727'>overlooked.  It was plain to me that La Cote Male Taile had failed</div><div class='line' id='LC3728'>to see the mistress of the house.  Often, how louder and clearer</div><div class='line' id='LC3729'>than any tongue, does dumb circumstantial evidence speak.</div><div class='line' id='LC3730'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3731'>Morgan le Fay rippled along as musically as ever.  Marvelous woman.</div><div class='line' id='LC3732'>And what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those</div><div class='line' id='LC3733'>servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the</div><div class='line' id='LC3734'>lightning flashes out of a cloud.  I could have got the habit</div><div class='line' id='LC3735'>myself.  It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens; he was</div><div class='line' id='LC3736'>always on the ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even turn</div><div class='line' id='LC3737'>toward him but he winced.</div><div class='line' id='LC3738'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3739'>In the midst of the talk I let drop a complimentary word about</div><div class='line' id='LC3740'>King Arthur, forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her</div><div class='line' id='LC3741'>brother.  That one little compliment was enough.  She clouded up</div><div class='line' id='LC3742'>like storm; she called for her guards, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3743'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3744'>&quot;Hale me these varlets to the dungeons.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3745'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3746'>That struck cold on my ears, for her dungeons had a reputation.</div><div class='line' id='LC3747'>Nothing occurred to me to say--or do.  But not so with Sandy.</div><div class='line' id='LC3748'>As the guard laid a hand upon me, she piped up with the tranquilest</div><div class='line' id='LC3749'>confidence, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3750'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3751'>&quot;God&#39;s wounds, dost thou covet destruction, thou maniac?  It is</div><div class='line' id='LC3752'>The Boss!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3753'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3754'>Now what a happy idea that was!--and so simple; yet it would never</div><div class='line' id='LC3755'>have occurred to me.  I was born modest; not all over, but in spots;</div><div class='line' id='LC3756'>and this was one of the spots.</div><div class='line' id='LC3757'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3758'>The effect upon madame was electrical.  It cleared her countenance</div><div class='line' id='LC3759'>and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and</div><div class='line' id='LC3760'>blandishments; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up</div><div class='line' id='LC3761'>with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright. She said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3762'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3763'>&quot;La, but do list to thine handmaid! as if one gifted with powers</div><div class='line' id='LC3764'>like to mine might say the thing which I have said unto one who</div><div class='line' id='LC3765'>has vanquished Merlin, and not be jesting.  By mine enchantments</div><div class='line' id='LC3766'>I foresaw your coming, and by them I knew you when you entered</div><div class='line' id='LC3767'>here.  I did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you</div><div class='line' id='LC3768'>into some display of your art, as not doubting you would blast</div><div class='line' id='LC3769'>the guards with occult fires, consuming them to ashes on the spot,</div><div class='line' id='LC3770'>a marvel much beyond mine own ability, yet one which I have long</div><div class='line' id='LC3771'>been childishly curious to see.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3772'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3773'>The guards were less curious, and got out as soon as they got permission.</div><div class='line' id='LC3774'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3775'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3776'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3777'>CHAPTER XVII</div><div class='line' id='LC3778'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3779'>A ROYAL BANQUET</div><div class='line' id='LC3780'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3781'>Madame, seeing me pacific and unresentful, no doubt judged that</div><div class='line' id='LC3782'>I was deceived by her excuse; for her fright dissolved away, and</div><div class='line' id='LC3783'>she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill</div><div class='line' id='LC3784'>somebody, that the thing grew to be embarrassing.  However, to my</div><div class='line' id='LC3785'>relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers.  I will</div><div class='line' id='LC3786'>say this much for the nobility: that, tyrannical, murderous,</div><div class='line' id='LC3787'>rapacious, and morally rotten as they were, they were deeply and</div><div class='line' id='LC3788'>enthusiastically religious.  Nothing could divert them from the</div><div class='line' id='LC3789'>regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the</div><div class='line' id='LC3790'>Church.  More than once I had seen a noble who had gotten his</div><div class='line' id='LC3791'>enemy at a disadvantage, stop to pray before cutting his throat;</div><div class='line' id='LC3792'>more than once I had seen a noble, after ambushing and despatching</div><div class='line' id='LC3793'>his enemy, retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give</div><div class='line' id='LC3794'>thanks, without even waiting to rob the body.  There was to be</div><div class='line' id='LC3795'>nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even Benvenuto Cellini,</div><div class='line' id='LC3796'>that rough-hewn saint, ten centuries later.  All the nobles of</div><div class='line' id='LC3797'>Britain, with their families, attended divine service morning and</div><div class='line' id='LC3798'>night daily, in their private chapels, and even the worst of them</div><div class='line' id='LC3799'>had family worship five or six times a day besides.  The credit</div><div class='line' id='LC3800'>of this belonged entirely to the Church.  Although I was no friend</div><div class='line' id='LC3801'>to that Catholic Church, I was obliged to admit this.  And often,</div><div class='line' id='LC3802'>in spite of me, I found myself saying, &quot;What would this country</div><div class='line' id='LC3803'>be without the Church?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3804'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3805'>After prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was</div><div class='line' id='LC3806'>lighted by hundreds of grease-jets, and everything was as fine and</div><div class='line' id='LC3807'>lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the</div><div class='line' id='LC3808'>hosts.  At the head of the hall, on a dais, was the table of the</div><div class='line' id='LC3809'>king, queen, and their son, Prince Uwaine.  Stretching down the hall</div><div class='line' id='LC3810'>from this, was the general table, on the floor.  At this, above</div><div class='line' id='LC3811'>the salt, sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their</div><div class='line' id='LC3812'>families, of both sexes,--the resident Court, in effect--sixty-one</div><div class='line' id='LC3813'>persons; below the salt sat minor officers of the household, with</div><div class='line' id='LC3814'>their principal subordinates: altogether a hundred and eighteen</div><div class='line' id='LC3815'>persons sitting, and about as many liveried servants standing</div><div class='line' id='LC3816'>behind their chairs, or serving in one capacity or another.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC3817'>a very fine show.  In a gallery a band with cymbals, horns, harps,</div><div class='line' id='LC3818'>and other horrors, opened the proceedings with what seemed to be</div><div class='line' id='LC3819'>the crude first-draft or original agony of the wail known to later</div><div class='line' id='LC3820'>centuries as &quot;In the Sweet Bye and Bye.&quot;  It was new, and ought</div><div class='line' id='LC3821'>to have been rehearsed a little more.  For some reason or other</div><div class='line' id='LC3822'>the queen had the composer hanged, after dinner.</div><div class='line' id='LC3823'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3824'>After this music, the priest who stood behind the royal table said</div><div class='line' id='LC3825'>a noble long grace in ostensible Latin.  Then the battalion of</div><div class='line' id='LC3826'>waiters broke away from their posts, and darted, rushed, flew,</div><div class='line' id='LC3827'>fetched and carried, and the mighty feeding began; no words</div><div class='line' id='LC3828'>anywhere, but absorbing attention to business.  The rows of chops</div><div class='line' id='LC3829'>opened and shut in vast unison, and the sound of it was like to</div><div class='line' id='LC3830'>the muffled burr of subterranean machinery.</div><div class='line' id='LC3831'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3832'>The havoc continued an hour and a half, and unimaginable was the</div><div class='line' id='LC3833'>destruction of substantials.  Of the chief feature of the feast</div><div class='line' id='LC3834'>--the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing</div><div class='line' id='LC3835'>at the start--nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop-skirt;</div><div class='line' id='LC3836'>and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all</div><div class='line' id='LC3837'>the other dishes.</div><div class='line' id='LC3838'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3839'>With the pastries and so on, the heavy drinking began--and the talk.</div><div class='line' id='LC3840'>Gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared, and everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC3841'>got comfortable, then happy, then sparklingly joyous--both sexes,</div><div class='line' id='LC3842'>--and by and by pretty noisy.  Men told anecdotes that were terrific</div><div class='line' id='LC3843'>to hear, but nobody blushed; and when the nub was sprung, the</div><div class='line' id='LC3844'>assemblage let go with a horse-laugh that shook the fortress.</div><div class='line' id='LC3845'>Ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made</div><div class='line' id='LC3846'>Queen Margaret of Navarre or even the great Elizabeth of England</div><div class='line' id='LC3847'>hide behind a handkerchief, but nobody hid here, but only laughed</div><div class='line' id='LC3848'>--howled, you may say.  In pretty much all of these dreadful stories,</div><div class='line' id='LC3849'>ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes, but that didn&#39;t worry the</div><div class='line' id='LC3850'>chaplain any, he had his laugh with the rest; more than that, upon</div><div class='line' id='LC3851'>invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as</div><div class='line' id='LC3852'>any that was sung that night.</div><div class='line' id='LC3853'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3854'>By midnight everybody was fagged out, and sore with laughing; and,</div><div class='line' id='LC3855'>as a rule, drunk: some weepingly, some affectionately, some</div><div class='line' id='LC3856'>hilariously, some quarrelsomely, some dead and under the table.</div><div class='line' id='LC3857'>Of the ladies, the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess, whose</div><div class='line' id='LC3858'>wedding-eve this was; and indeed she was a spectacle, sure enough.</div><div class='line' id='LC3859'>Just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the</div><div class='line' id='LC3860'>young daughter of the Regent d&#39;Orleans, at the famous dinner whence</div><div class='line' id='LC3861'>she was carried, foul-mouthed, intoxicated, and helpless, to her bed,</div><div class='line' id='LC3862'>in the lost and lamented days of the Ancient Regime.</div><div class='line' id='LC3863'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3864'>Suddenly, even while the priest was lifting his hands, and all</div><div class='line' id='LC3865'>conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming</div><div class='line' id='LC3866'>blessing, there appeared under the arch of the far-off door at</div><div class='line' id='LC3867'>the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white-haired lady,</div><div class='line' id='LC3868'>leaning upon a crutch-stick; and she lifted the stick and pointed it</div><div class='line' id='LC3869'>toward the queen and cried out:</div><div class='line' id='LC3870'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3871'>&quot;The wrath and curse of God fall upon you, woman without pity,</div><div class='line' id='LC3872'>who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this</div><div class='line' id='LC3873'>old heart that had nor chick, nor friend nor stay nor comfort in</div><div class='line' id='LC3874'>all this world but him!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3875'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3876'>Everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright, for a curse was an</div><div class='line' id='LC3877'>awful thing to those people; but the queen rose up majestic, with</div><div class='line' id='LC3878'>the death-light in her eye, and flung back this ruthless command:</div><div class='line' id='LC3879'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3880'>&quot;Lay hands on her!  To the stake with her!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3881'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3882'>The guards left their posts to obey.  It was a shame; it was a</div><div class='line' id='LC3883'>cruel thing to see.  What could be done?  Sandy gave me a look;</div><div class='line' id='LC3884'>I knew she had another inspiration.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3885'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3886'>&quot;Do what you choose.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3887'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3888'>She was up and facing toward the queen in a moment.  She indicated</div><div class='line' id='LC3889'>me, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3890'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3891'>&quot;Madame, _he_ saith this may not be.  Recall the commandment, or he</div><div class='line' id='LC3892'>will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable</div><div class='line' id='LC3893'>fabric of a dream!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3894'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3895'>Confound it, what a crazy contract to pledge a person to!  What if</div><div class='line' id='LC3896'>the queen--</div><div class='line' id='LC3897'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3898'>But my consternation subsided there, and my panic passed off;</div><div class='line' id='LC3899'>for the queen, all in a collapse, made no show of resistance but</div><div class='line' id='LC3900'>gave a countermanding sign and sunk into her seat.  When she reached</div><div class='line' id='LC3901'>it she was sober.  So were many of the others.  The assemblage rose,</div><div class='line' id='LC3902'>whiffed ceremony to the winds, and rushed for the door like a mob;</div><div class='line' id='LC3903'>overturning chairs, smashing crockery, tugging, struggling,</div><div class='line' id='LC3904'>shouldering, crowding--anything to get out before I should change</div><div class='line' id='LC3905'>my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of</div><div class='line' id='LC3906'>space.  Well, well, well, they _were_ a superstitious lot.  It is</div><div class='line' id='LC3907'>all a body can do to conceive of it.</div><div class='line' id='LC3908'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3909'>The poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid</div><div class='line' id='LC3910'>to hang the composer without first consulting me.  I was very sorry</div><div class='line' id='LC3911'>for her--indeed, any one would have been, for she was really</div><div class='line' id='LC3912'>suffering; so I was willing to do anything that was reasonable, and</div><div class='line' id='LC3913'>had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities.  I therefore</div><div class='line' id='LC3914'>considered the matter thoughtfully, and ended by having the</div><div class='line' id='LC3915'>musicians ordered into our presence to play that Sweet Bye and</div><div class='line' id='LC3916'>Bye again, which they did.  Then I saw that she was right, and</div><div class='line' id='LC3917'>gave her permission to hang the whole band.  This little relaxation</div><div class='line' id='LC3918'>of sternness had a good effect upon the queen.  A statesman gains</div><div class='line' id='LC3919'>little by the arbitrary exercise of iron-clad authority upon all</div><div class='line' id='LC3920'>occasions that offer, for this wounds the just pride of his</div><div class='line' id='LC3921'>subordinates, and thus tends to undermine his strength.  A little</div><div class='line' id='LC3922'>concession, now and then, where it can do no harm, is the wiser policy.</div><div class='line' id='LC3923'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3924'>Now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more, and measurably</div><div class='line' id='LC3925'>happy, her wine naturally began to assert itself again, and it got</div><div class='line' id='LC3926'>a little the start of her.  I mean it set her music going--her silver</div><div class='line' id='LC3927'>bell of a tongue.  Dear me, she was a master talker.  It would not</div><div class='line' id='LC3928'>become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that I was a tired</div><div class='line' id='LC3929'>man and very sleepy.  I wished I had gone off to bed when I had</div><div class='line' id='LC3930'>the chance.  Now I must stick it out; there was no other way.  So</div><div class='line' id='LC3931'>she tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly</div><div class='line' id='LC3932'>hush of the sleeping castle, until by and by there came, as if</div><div class='line' id='LC3933'>from deep down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek</div><div class='line' id='LC3934'>--with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl.</div><div class='line' id='LC3935'>The queen stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; she tilted</div><div class='line' id='LC3936'>her graceful head as a bird does when it listens.  The sound bored</div><div class='line' id='LC3937'>its way up through the stillness again.</div><div class='line' id='LC3938'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3939'>&quot;What is it?&quot; I said.</div><div class='line' id='LC3940'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3941'>&quot;It is truly a stubborn soul, and endureth long.  It is many hours now.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3942'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3943'>&quot;Endureth what?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3944'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3945'>&quot;The rack.  Come--ye shall see a blithe sight.  An he yield not</div><div class='line' id='LC3946'>his secret now, ye shall see him torn asunder.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3947'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3948'>What a silky smooth hellion she was; and so composed and serene,</div><div class='line' id='LC3949'>when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that</div><div class='line' id='LC3950'>man&#39;s pain.  Conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches,</div><div class='line' id='LC3951'>we tramped along echoing corridors, and down stone stairways dank</div><div class='line' id='LC3952'>and dripping, and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night</div><div class='line' id='LC3953'>--a chill, uncanny journey and a long one, and not made the shorter</div><div class='line' id='LC3954'>or the cheerier by the sorceress&#39;s talk, which was about this</div><div class='line' id='LC3955'>sufferer and his crime.  He had been accused by an anonymous</div><div class='line' id='LC3956'>informer, of having killed a stag in the royal preserves.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC3957'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3958'>&quot;Anonymous testimony isn&#39;t just the right thing, your Highness.</div><div class='line' id='LC3959'>It were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3960'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3961'>&quot;I had not thought of that, it being but of small consequence.</div><div class='line' id='LC3962'>But an I would, I could not, for that the accuser came masked by</div><div class='line' id='LC3963'>night, and told the forester, and straightway got him hence again,</div><div class='line' id='LC3964'>and so the forester knoweth him not.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3965'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3966'>&quot;Then is this Unknown the only person who saw the stag killed?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3967'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3968'>&quot;Marry, _no_ man _saw_ the killing, but this Unknown saw this hardy</div><div class='line' id='LC3969'>wretch near to the spot where the stag lay, and came with right</div><div class='line' id='LC3970'>loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3971'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3972'>&quot;So the Unknown was near the dead stag, too?  Isn&#39;t it just possible</div><div class='line' id='LC3973'>that he did the killing himself?  His loyal zeal--in a mask--looks</div><div class='line' id='LC3974'>just a shade suspicious.  But what is your highness&#39;s idea for</div><div class='line' id='LC3975'>racking the prisoner?  Where is the profit?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3976'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3977'>&quot;He will not confess, else; and then were his soul lost.  For his</div><div class='line' id='LC3978'>crime his life is forfeited by the law--and of a surety will I see</div><div class='line' id='LC3979'>that he payeth it!--but it were peril to my own soul to let him</div><div class='line' id='LC3980'>die unconfessed and unabsolved.  Nay, I were a fool to fling me</div><div class='line' id='LC3981'>into hell for _his_ accommodation.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3982'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3983'>&quot;But, your Highness, suppose he has nothing to confess?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3984'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3985'>&quot;As to that, we shall see, anon.  An I rack him to death and he</div><div class='line' id='LC3986'>confess not, it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught</div><div class='line' id='LC3987'>to confess--ye will grant that that is sooth?  Then shall I not be</div><div class='line' id='LC3988'>damned for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess</div><div class='line' id='LC3989'>--wherefore, I shall be safe.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3990'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3991'>It was the stubborn unreasoning of the time.  It was useless to</div><div class='line' id='LC3992'>argue with her.  Arguments have no chance against petrified</div><div class='line' id='LC3993'>training; they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC3994'>her training was everybody&#39;s.  The brightest intellect in the land</div><div class='line' id='LC3995'>would not have been able to see that her position was defective.</div><div class='line' id='LC3996'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC3997'>As we entered the rack-cell I caught a picture that will not go</div><div class='line' id='LC3998'>from me; I wish it would.  A native young giant of thirty or</div><div class='line' id='LC3999'>thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back, with his</div><div class='line' id='LC4000'>wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either</div><div class='line' id='LC4001'>end.  There was no color in him; his features were contorted and</div><div class='line' id='LC4002'>set, and sweat-drops stood upon his forehead.  A priest bent over</div><div class='line' id='LC4003'>him on each side; the executioner stood by; guards were on duty;</div><div class='line' id='LC4004'>smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls; in a corner</div><div class='line' id='LC4005'>crouched a poor young creature, her face drawn with anguish,</div><div class='line' id='LC4006'>a half-wild and hunted look in her eyes, and in her lap lay a little</div><div class='line' id='LC4007'>child asleep.  Just as we stepped across the threshold the</div><div class='line' id='LC4008'>executioner gave his machine a slight turn, which wrung a cry</div><div class='line' id='LC4009'>from both the prisoner and the woman; but I shouted, and the</div><div class='line' id='LC4010'>executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke.</div><div class='line' id='LC4011'>I could not let this horror go on; it would have killed me to</div><div class='line' id='LC4012'>see it.  I asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak</div><div class='line' id='LC4013'>to the prisoner privately; and when she was going to object I spoke</div><div class='line' id='LC4014'>in a low voice and said I did not want to make a scene before</div><div class='line' id='LC4015'>her servants, but I must have my way; for I was King Arthur&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4016'>representative, and was speaking in his name.  She saw she had</div><div class='line' id='LC4017'>to yield.  I asked her to indorse me to these people, and then</div><div class='line' id='LC4018'>leave me.  It was not pleasant for her, but she took the pill;</div><div class='line' id='LC4019'>and even went further than I was meaning to require.  I only wanted</div><div class='line' id='LC4020'>the backing of her own authority; but she said:</div><div class='line' id='LC4021'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4022'>&quot;Ye will do in all things as this lord shall command.  It is The Boss.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4023'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4024'>It was certainly a good word to conjure with: you could see it</div><div class='line' id='LC4025'>by the squirming of these rats.  The queen&#39;s guards fell into line,</div><div class='line' id='LC4026'>and she and they marched away, with their torch-bearers, and woke</div><div class='line' id='LC4027'>the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their</div><div class='line' id='LC4028'>retreating footfalls.  I had the prisoner taken from the rack and</div><div class='line' id='LC4029'>placed upon his bed, and medicaments applied to his hurts, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4030'>wine given him to drink.  The woman crept near and looked on,</div><div class='line' id='LC4031'>eagerly, lovingly, but timorously,--like one who fears a repulse;</div><div class='line' id='LC4032'>indeed, she tried furtively to touch the man&#39;s forehead, and jumped</div><div class='line' id='LC4033'>back, the picture of fright, when I turned unconsciously toward</div><div class='line' id='LC4034'>her.  It was pitiful to see.</div><div class='line' id='LC4035'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4036'>&quot;Lord,&quot; I said, &quot;stroke him, lass, if you want to.  Do anything</div><div class='line' id='LC4037'>you&#39;re a mind to; don&#39;t mind me.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4038'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4039'>Why, her eyes were as grateful as an animal&#39;s, when you do it</div><div class='line' id='LC4040'>a kindness that it understands.  The baby was out of her way and</div><div class='line' id='LC4041'>she had her cheek against the man&#39;s in a minute and her hands</div><div class='line' id='LC4042'>fondling his hair, and her happy tears running down.  The man</div><div class='line' id='LC4043'>revived and caressed his wife with his eyes, which was all he</div><div class='line' id='LC4044'>could do.  I judged I might clear the den, now, and I did; cleared</div><div class='line' id='LC4045'>it of all but the family and myself.  Then I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC4046'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4047'>&quot;Now, my friend, tell me your side of this matter; I know</div><div class='line' id='LC4048'>the other side.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4049'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4050'>The man moved his head in sign of refusal.  But the woman looked</div><div class='line' id='LC4051'>pleased--as it seemed to me--pleased with my suggestion.  I went on--</div><div class='line' id='LC4052'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4053'>&quot;You know of me?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4054'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4055'>&quot;Yes.  All do, in Arthur&#39;s realms.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4056'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4057'>&quot;If my reputation has come to you right and straight, you should</div><div class='line' id='LC4058'>not be afraid to speak.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4059'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4060'>The woman broke in, eagerly:</div><div class='line' id='LC4061'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4062'>&quot;Ah, fair my lord, do thou persuade him!  Thou canst an thou wilt.</div><div class='line' id='LC4063'>Ah, he suffereth so; and it is for me--for _me_!  And how can I bear it?</div><div class='line' id='LC4064'>I would I might see him die--a sweet, swift death; oh, my Hugo,</div><div class='line' id='LC4065'>I cannot bear this one!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4066'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4067'>And she fell to sobbing and grovelling about my feet, and still</div><div class='line' id='LC4068'>imploring.  Imploring what?  The man&#39;s death?  I could not quite</div><div class='line' id='LC4069'>get the bearings of the thing.  But Hugo interrupted her and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC4070'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4071'>&quot;Peace!  Ye wit not what ye ask.  Shall I starve whom I love,</div><div class='line' id='LC4072'>to win a gentle death?  I wend thou knewest me better.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4073'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4074'>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I can&#39;t quite make this out.  It is a puzzle.  Now--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4075'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4076'>&quot;Ah, dear my lord, an ye will but persuade him!  Consider how</div><div class='line' id='LC4077'>these his tortures wound me!  Oh, and he will not speak!--whereas,</div><div class='line' id='LC4078'>the healing, the solace that lie in a blessed swift death--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4079'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4080'>&quot;What _are_ you maundering about?  He&#39;s going out from here a free</div><div class='line' id='LC4081'>man and whole--he&#39;s not going to die.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4082'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4083'>The man&#39;s white face lit up, and the woman flung herself at me</div><div class='line' id='LC4084'>in a most surprising explosion of joy, and cried out:</div><div class='line' id='LC4085'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4086'>&quot;He is saved!--for it is the king&#39;s word by the mouth of the king&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4087'>servant--Arthur, the king whose word is gold!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4088'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4089'>&quot;Well, then you do believe I can be trusted, after all.

The priests told me about this, and were generously</div><div class='line' id='LC4147'>hot to have him punished.  Something of this disagreeable sort</div><div class='line' id='LC4148'>was turning up every now and then.  I mean, episodes that showed</div><div class='line' id='LC4149'>that not all priests were frauds and self-seekers, but that many,</div><div class='line' id='LC4150'>even the great majority, of these that were down on the ground</div><div class='line' id='LC4151'>among the common people, were sincere and right-hearted, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4152'>devoted to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings.</div><div class='line' id='LC4153'>Well, it was a thing which could not be helped, so I seldom fretted</div><div class='line' id='LC4154'>about it, and never many minutes at a time; it has never been my</div><div class='line' id='LC4155'>way to bother much about things which you can&#39;t cure.  But I did</div><div class='line' id='LC4156'>not like it, for it was just the sort of thing to keep people</div><div class='line' id='LC4157'>reconciled to an Established Church.  We _must_ have a religion</div><div class='line' id='LC4158'>--it goes without saying--but my idea is, to have it cut up into</div><div class='line' id='LC4159'>forty free sects, so that they will police each other, as had been</div><div class='line' id='LC4160'>the case in the United States in my time.  Concentration of power</div><div class='line' id='LC4161'>in a political machine is bad; and an Established Church is</div><div class='line' id='LC4162'>only a political machine; it was invented for that; it is nursed,</div><div class='line' id='LC4163'>cradled, preserved for that; it is an enemy to human liberty, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4164'>does no good which it could not better do in a split-up and scattered</div><div class='line' id='LC4165'>condition.  That wasn&#39;t law; it wasn&#39;t gospel: it was only</div><div class='line' id='LC4166'>an opinion--my opinion, and I was only a man, one man: so it wasn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC4167'>worth any more than the pope&#39;s--or any less, for that matter.</div><div class='line' id='LC4168'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4169'>Well, I couldn&#39;t rack the executioner, neither would I overlook</div><div class='line' id='LC4170'>the just complaint of the priests.  The man must be punished</div><div class='line' id='LC4171'>somehow or other, so I degraded him from his office and made him</div><div class='line' id='LC4172'>leader of the band--the new one that was to be started.  He begged</div><div class='line' id='LC4173'>hard, and said he couldn&#39;t play--a plausible excuse, but too thin;</div><div class='line' id='LC4174'>there wasn&#39;t a musician in the country that could.</div><div class='line' id='LC4175'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4176'>The queen was a good deal outraged, next morning when she found</div><div class='line' id='LC4177'>she was going to have neither Hugo&#39;s life nor his property.  But</div><div class='line' id='LC4178'>I told her she must bear this cross; that while by law and custom</div><div class='line' id='LC4179'>she certainly was entitled to both the man&#39;s life and his property,</div><div class='line' id='LC4180'>there were extenuating circumstances, and so in Arthur the king&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4181'>name I had pardoned him.  The deer was ravaging the man&#39;s fields,</div><div class='line' id='LC4182'>and he had killed it in sudden passion, and not for gain; and he</div><div class='line' id='LC4183'>had carried it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make</div><div class='line' id='LC4184'>detection of the misdoer impossible.  Confound her, I couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC4185'>make her see that sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance</div><div class='line' id='LC4186'>in the killing of venison--or of a person--so I gave it up and let</div><div class='line' id='LC4187'>her sulk it out.  I _did_ think I was going to make her see it by</div><div class='line' id='LC4188'>remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the page</div><div class='line' id='LC4189'>modified that crime.</div><div class='line' id='LC4190'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4191'>&quot;Crime!&quot; she exclaimed.  &quot;How thou talkest!

Training--training is</div><div class='line' id='LC4195'>everything; training is all there is _to_ a person.  We speak of</div><div class='line' id='LC4196'>nature; it is folly; there is no such thing as nature; what we</div><div class='line' id='LC4197'>call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training.</div><div class='line' id='LC4198'>We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; they are</div><div class='line' id='LC4199'>transmitted to us, trained into us.  All that is original in us,</div><div class='line' id='LC4200'>and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us, can be</div><div class='line' id='LC4201'>covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the</div><div class='line' id='LC4202'>rest being atoms contributed by, and inherited from, a procession</div><div class='line' id='LC4203'>of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the Adam-clam</div><div class='line' id='LC4204'>or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously</div><div class='line' id='LC4205'>and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed.  And as for me,</div><div class='line' id='LC4206'>all that I think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage, this</div><div class='line' id='LC4207'>pathetic drift between the eternities, is to look out and humbly</div><div class='line' id='LC4208'>live a pure and high and blameless life, and save that one</div><div class='line' id='LC4209'>microscopic atom in me that is truly _me_: the rest may land in</div><div class='line' id='LC4210'>Sheol and welcome for all I care.</div><div class='line' id='LC4211'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4212'>No, confound her, her intellect was good, she had brains enough,</div><div class='line' id='LC4213'>but her training made her an ass--that is, from a many-centuries-later</div><div class='line' id='LC4214'>point of view.  To kill the page was no crime--it was her right;</div><div class='line' id='LC4215'>and upon her right she stood, serenely and unconscious of offense.</div><div class='line' id='LC4216'>She was a result of generations of training in the unexamined and</div><div class='line' id='LC4217'>unassailed belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject</div><div class='line' id='LC4218'>when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one.</div><div class='line' id='LC4219'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4220'>Well, we must give even Satan his due.  She deserved a compliment</div><div class='line' id='LC4221'>for one thing; and I tried to pay it, but the words stuck in my</div><div class='line' id='LC4222'>throat.  She had a right to kill the boy, but she was in no wise</div><div class='line' id='LC4223'>obliged to pay for him.  That was law for some other people, but</div><div class='line' id='LC4224'>not for her.  She knew quite well that she was doing a large and</div><div class='line' id='LC4225'>generous thing to pay for that lad, and that I ought in common</div><div class='line' id='LC4226'>fairness to come out with something handsome about it, but I</div><div class='line' id='LC4227'>couldn&#39;t--my mouth refused.  I couldn&#39;t help seeing, in my fancy,</div><div class='line' id='LC4228'>that poor old grandma with the broken heart, and that fair young</div><div class='line' id='LC4229'>creature lying butchered, his little silken pomps and vanities</div><div class='line' id='LC4230'>laced with his golden blood.  How could she _pay_ for him!  _Whom_</div><div class='line' id='LC4231'>could she pay?  And so, well knowing that this woman, trained</div><div class='line' id='LC4232'>as she had been, deserved praise, even adulation, I was yet not</div><div class='line' id='LC4233'>able to utter it, trained as I had been.  The best I could do was</div><div class='line' id='LC4234'>to fish up a compliment from outside, so to speak--and the pity</div><div class='line' id='LC4235'>of it was, that it was true:</div><div class='line' id='LC4236'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4237'>&quot;Madame, your people will adore you for this.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4238'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4239'>Quite true, but I meant to hang her for it some day if I lived.</div><div class='line' id='LC4240'>Some of those laws were too bad, altogether too bad.  A master</div><div class='line' id='LC4241'>might kill his slave for nothing--for mere spite, malice, or</div><div class='line' id='LC4242'>to pass the time--just as we have seen that the crowned head could</div><div class='line' id='LC4243'>do it with _his_ slave, that is to say, anybody.  A gentleman could</div><div class='line' id='LC4244'>kill a free commoner, and pay for him--cash or garden-truck.</div><div class='line' id='LC4245'>A noble could kill a noble without expense, as far as the law was</div><div class='line' id='LC4246'>concerned, but reprisals in kind were to be expected.  _Any_body</div><div class='line' id='LC4247'>could kill _some_body, except the commoner and the slave; these had</div><div class='line' id='LC4248'>no privileges.  If they killed, it was murder, and the law wouldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC4249'>stand murder.  It made short work of the experimenter--and of</div><div class='line' id='LC4250'>his family, too, if he murdered somebody who belonged up among</div><div class='line' id='LC4251'>the ornamental ranks.  If a commoner gave a noble even so much</div><div class='line' id='LC4252'>as a Damiens-scratch which didn&#39;t kill or even hurt, he got Damiens&#39;</div><div class='line' id='LC4253'>dose for it just the same; they pulled him to rags and tatters</div><div class='line' id='LC4254'>with horses, and all the world came to see the show, and crack</div><div class='line' id='LC4255'>jokes, and have a good time; and some of the performances of the</div><div class='line' id='LC4256'>best people present were as tough, and as properly unprintable,</div><div class='line' id='LC4257'>as any that have been printed by the pleasant Casanova in his</div><div class='line' id='LC4258'>chapter about the dismemberment of Louis XV&#39;s poor awkward enemy.</div><div class='line' id='LC4259'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4260'>I had had enough of this grisly place by this time, and wanted</div><div class='line' id='LC4261'>to leave, but I couldn&#39;t, because I had something on my mind that</div><div class='line' id='LC4262'>my conscience kept prodding me about, and wouldn&#39;t let me forget.</div><div class='line' id='LC4263'>If I had the remaking of man, he wouldn&#39;t have any conscience.</div><div class='line' id='LC4264'>It is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person;</div><div class='line' id='LC4265'>and although it certainly does a great deal of good, it cannot</div><div class='line' id='LC4266'>be said to pay, in the long run; it would be much better to have</div><div class='line' id='LC4267'>less good and more comfort.  Still, this is only my opinion, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4268'>I am only one man; others, with less experience, may think</div><div class='line' id='LC4269'>differently.  They have a right to their view.  I only stand</div><div class='line' id='LC4270'>to this: I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I know</div><div class='line' id='LC4271'>it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started</div><div class='line' id='LC4272'>with.  I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we</div><div class='line' id='LC4273'>prize anything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so.</div><div class='line' id='LC4274'>If we look at it in another way, we see how absurd it is: if I had</div><div class='line' id='LC4275'>an anvil in me would I prize it?  Of course not.  And yet when you</div><div class='line' id='LC4276'>come to think, there is no real difference between a conscience</div><div class='line' id='LC4277'>and an anvil--I mean for comfort.  I have noticed it a thousand</div><div class='line' id='LC4278'>times.  And you could dissolve an anvil with acids, when you</div><div class='line' id='LC4279'>couldn&#39;t stand it any longer; but there isn&#39;t any way that you can</div><div class='line' id='LC4280'>work off a conscience--at least so it will stay worked off; not</div><div class='line' id='LC4281'>that I know of, anyway.</div><div class='line' id='LC4282'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4283'>There was something I wanted to do before leaving, but it was</div><div class='line' id='LC4284'>a disagreeable matter, and I hated to go at it.  Well, it bothered</div><div class='line' id='LC4285'>me all the morning.  I could have mentioned it to the old king,</div><div class='line' id='LC4286'>but what would be the use?--he was but an extinct volcano; he had</div><div class='line' id='LC4287'>been active in his time, but his fire was out, this good while,</div><div class='line' id='LC4288'>he was only a stately ash-pile now; gentle enough, and kindly</div><div class='line' id='LC4289'>enough for my purpose, without doubt, but not usable.  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC4290'>nothing, this so-called king: the queen was the only power there.</div><div class='line' id='LC4291'>And she was a Vesuvius.  As a favor, she might consent to warm</div><div class='line' id='LC4292'>a flock of sparrows for you, but then she might take that very</div><div class='line' id='LC4293'>opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city.  However,</div><div class='line' id='LC4294'>I reflected that as often as any other way, when you are expecting</div><div class='line' id='LC4295'>the worst, you get something that is not so bad, after all.</div><div class='line' id='LC4296'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4297'>So I braced up and placed my matter before her royal Highness.</div><div class='line' id='LC4298'>I said I had been having a general jail-delivery at Camelot and</div><div class='line' id='LC4299'>among neighboring castles, and with her permission I would like</div><div class='line' id='LC4300'>to examine her collection, her bric-a-brac--that is to say, her</div><div class='line' id='LC4301'>prisoners.  She resisted; but I was expecting that.  But she finally</div><div class='line' id='LC4302'>consented.  I was expecting that, too, but not so soon.  That about</div><div class='line' id='LC4303'>ended my discomfort.  She called her guards and torches, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4304'>we went down into the dungeons.  These were down under the castle&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4305'>foundations, and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living</div><div class='line' id='LC4306'>rock.  Some of these cells had no light at all.  In one of them was</div><div class='line' id='LC4307'>a woman, in foul rags, who sat on the ground, and would not answer</div><div class='line' id='LC4308'>a question or speak a word, but only looked up at us once or twice,</div><div class='line' id='LC4309'>through a cobweb of tangled hair, as if to see what casual thing</div><div class='line' id='LC4310'>it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless</div><div class='line' id='LC4311'>dull dream that was become her life; after that, she sat bowed,</div><div class='line' id='LC4312'>with her dirt-caked fingers idly interlocked in her lap, and gave</div><div class='line' id='LC4313'>no further sign.  This poor rack of bones was a woman of middle</div><div class='line' id='LC4314'>age, apparently; but only apparently; she had been there nine</div><div class='line' id='LC4315'>years, and was eighteen when she entered.  She was a commoner,</div><div class='line' id='LC4316'>and had been sent here on her bridal night by Sir Breuse Sance Pite,</div><div class='line' id='LC4317'>a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was, and to which said</div><div class='line' id='LC4318'>lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du</div><div class='line' id='LC4319'>seigneur, and, moreover, had opposed violence to violence and spilt</div><div class='line' id='LC4320'>half a gill of his almost sacred blood.  The young husband had</div><div class='line' id='LC4321'>interfered at that point, believing the bride&#39;s life in danger,</div><div class='line' id='LC4322'>and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and</div><div class='line' id='LC4323'>trembling wedding guests, in the parlor, and left him there</div><div class='line' id='LC4324'>astonished at this strange treatment, and implacably embittered</div><div class='line' id='LC4325'>against both bride and groom.  The said lord being cramped for</div><div class='line' id='LC4326'>dungeon-room had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals,</div><div class='line' id='LC4327'>and here in her bastile they had been ever since; hither, indeed,</div><div class='line' id='LC4328'>they had come before their crime was an hour old, and had never</div><div class='line' id='LC4329'>seen each other since.  Here they were, kenneled like toads in the</div><div class='line' id='LC4330'>same rock; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet</div><div class='line' id='LC4331'>of each other, yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not.</div><div class='line' id='LC4332'>All the first years, their only question had been--asked with</div><div class='line' id='LC4333'>beseechings and tears that might have moved stones, in time,</div><div class='line' id='LC4334'>perhaps, but hearts are not stones: &quot;Is he alive?&quot;  &quot;Is she alive?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4335'>But they had never got an answer; and at last that question was</div><div class='line' id='LC4336'>not asked any more--or any other.</div><div class='line' id='LC4337'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4338'>I wanted to see the man, after hearing all this.  He was thirty-four</div><div class='line' id='LC4339'>years old, and looked sixty.  He sat upon a squared block of</div><div class='line' id='LC4340'>stone, with his head bent down, his forearms resting on his knees,</div><div class='line' id='LC4341'>his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face, and he was</div><div class='line' id='LC4342'>muttering to himself.  He raised his chin and looked us slowly</div><div class='line' id='LC4343'>over, in a listless dull way, blinking with the distress of the</div><div class='line' id='LC4344'>torchlight, then dropped his head and fell to muttering again</div><div class='line' id='LC4345'>and took no further notice of us.  There were some pathetically</div><div class='line' id='LC4346'>suggestive dumb witnesses present.  On his wrists and ankles were</div><div class='line' id='LC4347'>cicatrices, old smooth scars, and fastened to the stone on which</div><div class='line' id='LC4348'>he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached; but this</div><div class='line' id='LC4349'>apparatus lay idle on the ground, and was thick with rust.  Chains</div><div class='line' id='LC4350'>cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner.</div><div class='line' id='LC4351'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4352'>I could not rouse the man; so I said we would take him to her,</div><div class='line' id='LC4353'>and see--to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him,</div><div class='line' id='LC4354'>once--roses, pearls, and dew made flesh, for him; a wonder-work,</div><div class='line' id='LC4355'>the master-work of nature: with eyes like no other eyes, and voice</div><div class='line' id='LC4356'>like no other voice, and a freshness, and lithe young grace, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4357'>beauty, that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams--as he</div><div class='line' id='LC4358'>thought--and to no other.  The sight of her would set his stagnant</div><div class='line' id='LC4359'>blood leaping; the sight of her--</div><div class='line' id='LC4360'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4361'>But it was a disappointment.  They sat together on the ground and</div><div class='line' id='LC4362'>looked dimly wondering into each other&#39;s faces a while, with a</div><div class='line' id='LC4363'>sort of weak animal curiosity; then forgot each other&#39;s presence,</div><div class='line' id='LC4364'>and dropped their eyes, and you saw that they were away again and</div><div class='line' id='LC4365'>wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know</div><div class='line' id='LC4366'>nothing about.</div><div class='line' id='LC4367'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4368'>I had them taken out and sent to their friends.  The queen did not</div><div class='line' id='LC4369'>like it much.  Not that she felt any personal interest in the matter,</div><div class='line' id='LC4370'>but she thought it disrespectful to Sir Breuse Sance Pite.  However,</div><div class='line' id='LC4371'>I assured her that if he found he couldn&#39;t stand it I would fix him</div><div class='line' id='LC4372'>so that he could.</div><div class='line' id='LC4373'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4374'>I set forty-seven prisoners loose out of those awful rat-holes,</div><div class='line' id='LC4375'>and left only one in captivity.  He was a lord, and had killed</div><div class='line' id='LC4376'>another lord, a sort of kinsman of the queen.  That other lord</div><div class='line' id='LC4377'>had ambushed him to assassinate him, but this fellow had got the</div><div class='line' id='LC4378'>best of him and cut his throat.  However, it was not for that that</div><div class='line' id='LC4379'>I left him jailed, but for maliciously destroying the only public</div><div class='line' id='LC4380'>well in one of his wretched villages.  The queen was bound to hang</div><div class='line' id='LC4381'>him for killing her kinsman, but I would not allow it: it was no</div><div class='line' id='LC4382'>crime to kill an assassin.  But I said I was willing to let her</div><div class='line' id='LC4383'>hang him for destroying the well; so she concluded to put up with</div><div class='line' id='LC4384'>that, as it was better than nothing.</div><div class='line' id='LC4385'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4386'>Dear me, for what trifling offenses the most of those forty-seven</div><div class='line' id='LC4387'>men and women were shut up there!  Indeed, some were there for</div><div class='line' id='LC4388'>no distinct offense at all, but only to gratify somebody&#39;s spite;</div><div class='line' id='LC4389'>and not always the queen&#39;s by any means, but a friend&#39;s.  The newest</div><div class='line' id='LC4390'>prisoner&#39;s crime was a mere remark which he had made.  He said</div><div class='line' id='LC4391'>he believed that men were about all alike, and one man as good</div><div class='line' id='LC4392'>as another, barring clothes.  He said he believed that if you were</div><div class='line' id='LC4393'>to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd, he</div><div class='line' id='LC4394'>couldn&#39;t tell the king from a quack doctor, nor a duke from a hotel</div><div class='line' id='LC4395'>clerk.  Apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced</div><div class='line' id='LC4396'>to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training.  I set him loose and</div><div class='line' id='LC4397'>sent him to the Factory.</div><div class='line' id='LC4398'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4399'>Some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the</div><div class='line' id='LC4400'>face of the precipice, and in each of these an arrow-slit had been</div><div class='line' id='LC4401'>pierced outward to the daylight, and so the captive had a thin</div><div class='line' id='LC4402'>ray from the blessed sun for his comfort.  The case of one of</div><div class='line' id='LC4403'>these poor fellows was particularly hard.  From his dusky swallow&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4404'>hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out</div><div class='line' id='LC4405'>through the arrow-slit and see his own home off yonder in the</div><div class='line' id='LC4406'>valley; and for twenty-two years he had watched it, with heartache</div><div class='line' id='LC4407'>and longing, through that crack.  He could see the lights shine</div><div class='line' id='LC4408'>there at night, and in the daytime he could see figures go in and</div><div class='line' id='LC4409'>come out--his wife and children, some of them, no doubt, though</div><div class='line' id='LC4410'>he could not make out at that distance.  In the course of years</div><div class='line' id='LC4411'>he noted festivities there, and tried to rejoice, and wondered</div><div class='line' id='LC4412'>if they were weddings or what they might be.  And he noted funerals;</div><div class='line' id='LC4413'>and they wrung his heart.  He could make out the coffin, but he</div><div class='line' id='LC4414'>could not determine its size, and so could not tell whether it was</div><div class='line' id='LC4415'>wife or child.  He could see the procession form, with priests</div><div class='line' id='LC4416'>and mourners, and move solemnly away, bearing the secret with</div><div class='line' id='LC4417'>them.  He had left behind him five children and a wife; and in</div><div class='line' id='LC4418'>nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue, and none of them</div><div class='line' id='LC4419'>humble enough in pomp to denote a servant.  So he had lost five</div><div class='line' id='LC4420'>of his treasures; there must still be one remaining--one now</div><div class='line' id='LC4421'>infinitely, unspeakably precious,--but _which_ one? wife, or child?</div><div class='line' id='LC4422'>That was the question that tortured him, by night and by day,</div><div class='line' id='LC4423'>asleep and awake.  Well, to have an interest, of some sort, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4424'>half a ray of light, when you are in a dungeon, is a great support</div><div class='line' id='LC4425'>to the body and preserver of the intellect.  This man was in pretty</div><div class='line' id='LC4426'>good condition yet.  By the time he had finished telling me his</div><div class='line' id='LC4427'>distressful tale, I was in the same state of mind that you would</div><div class='line' id='LC4428'>have been in yourself, if you have got average human curiosity;</div><div class='line' id='LC4429'>that is to say, I was as burning up as he was to find out which</div><div class='line' id='LC4430'>member of the family it was that was left.  So I took him over</div><div class='line' id='LC4431'>home myself; and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was, too</div><div class='line' id='LC4432'>--typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy, and whole Niagaras of happy</div><div class='line' id='LC4433'>tears; and by George! we found the aforetime young matron graying</div><div class='line' id='LC4434'>toward the imminent verge of her half century, and the babies all</div><div class='line' id='LC4435'>men and women, and some of them married and experimenting familywise</div><div class='line' id='LC4436'>themselves--for not a soul of the tribe was dead!  Conceive of the</div><div class='line' id='LC4437'>ingenious devilishness of that queen: she had a special hatred for</div><div class='line' id='LC4438'>this prisoner, and she had _invented_ all those funerals herself,</div><div class='line' id='LC4439'>to scorch his heart with; and the sublimest stroke of genius of</div><div class='line' id='LC4440'>the whole thing was leaving the family-invoice a funeral _short_,</div><div class='line' id='LC4441'>so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing.</div><div class='line' id='LC4442'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4443'>But for me, he never would have got out.  Morgan le Fay hated him</div><div class='line' id='LC4444'>with her whole heart, and she never would have softened toward him.</div><div class='line' id='LC4445'>And yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than</div><div class='line' id='LC4446'>deliberate depravity.  He had said she had red hair.  Well, she</div><div class='line' id='LC4447'>had; but that was no way to speak of it.  When red-headed people</div><div class='line' id='LC4448'>are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn.</div><div class='line' id='LC4449'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4450'>Consider it: among these forty-seven captives there were five</div><div class='line' id='LC4451'>whose names, offenses, and dates of incarceration were no longer</div><div class='line' id='LC4452'>known!  One woman and four men--all bent, and wrinkled, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4453'>mind-extinguished patriarchs.  They themselves had long ago forgotten</div><div class='line' id='LC4454'>these details; at any rate they had mere vague theories about them,</div><div class='line' id='LC4455'>nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same</div><div class='line' id='LC4456'>way.  The succession of priests whose office it had been to pray</div><div class='line' id='LC4457'>daily with the captives and remind them that God had put them</div><div class='line' id='LC4458'>there, for some wise purpose or other, and teach them that patience,</div><div class='line' id='LC4459'>humbleness, and submission to oppression was what He loved to see</div><div class='line' id='LC4460'>in parties of a subordinate rank, had traditions about these poor</div><div class='line' id='LC4461'>old human ruins, but nothing more.  These traditions went but</div><div class='line' id='LC4462'>little way, for they concerned the length of the incarceration only,</div><div class='line' id='LC4463'>and not the names of the offenses.  And even by the help of</div><div class='line' id='LC4464'>tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of</div><div class='line' id='LC4465'>the five had seen daylight for thirty-five years: how much longer</div><div class='line' id='LC4466'>this privation has lasted was not guessable.  The king and the queen</div><div class='line' id='LC4467'>knew nothing about these poor creatures, except that they were</div><div class='line' id='LC4468'>heirlooms, assets inherited, along with the throne, from the former</div><div class='line' id='LC4469'>firm.  Nothing of their history had been transmitted with their</div><div class='line' id='LC4470'>persons, and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no</div><div class='line' id='LC4471'>value, and had felt no interest in them.  I said to the queen:</div><div class='line' id='LC4472'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4473'>&quot;Then why in the world didn&#39;t you set them free?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4474'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4475'>The question was a puzzler.  She didn&#39;t know _why_ she hadn&#39;t, the</div><div class='line' id='LC4476'>thing had never come up in her mind.  So here she was, forecasting</div><div class='line' id='LC4477'>the veritable history of future prisoners of the Castle d&#39;If,</div><div class='line' id='LC4478'>without knowing it.  It seemed plain to me now, that with her</div><div class='line' id='LC4479'>training, those inherited prisoners were merely property--nothing</div><div class='line' id='LC4480'>more, nothing less.  Well, when we inherit property, it does not</div><div class='line' id='LC4481'>occur to us to throw it away, even when we do not value it.</div><div class='line' id='LC4482'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4483'>When I brought my procession of human bats up into the open world</div><div class='line' id='LC4484'>and the glare of the afternoon sun--previously blindfolding them,</div><div class='line' id='LC4485'>in charity for eyes so long untortured by light--they were a</div><div class='line' id='LC4486'>spectacle to look at.  Skeletons, scarecrows, goblins, pathetic</div><div class='line' id='LC4487'>frights, every one; legitimatest possible children of Monarchy</div><div class='line' id='LC4488'>by the Grace of God and the Established Church.  I muttered absently:</div><div class='line' id='LC4489'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4490'>&quot;I _wish_ I could photograph them!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4491'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4492'>You have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they</div><div class='line' id='LC4493'>don&#39;t know the meaning of a new big word.  The more ignorant they</div><div class='line' id='LC4494'>are, the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you haven&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC4495'>shot over their heads.  The queen was just one of that sort, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4496'>was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it.  She</div><div class='line' id='LC4497'>hesitated a moment; then her face brightened up with sudden</div><div class='line' id='LC4498'>comprehension, and she said she would do it for me.</div><div class='line' id='LC4499'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4500'>I thought to myself: She? why what can she know about photography?</div><div class='line' id='LC4501'>But it was a poor time to be thinking.  When I looked around, she</div><div class='line' id='LC4502'>was moving on the procession with an axe!</div><div class='line' id='LC4503'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4504'>Well, she certainly was a curious one, was Morgan le Fay.  I have</div><div class='line' id='LC4505'>seen a good many kinds of women in my time, but she laid over them</div><div class='line' id='LC4506'>all for variety.  And how sharply characteristic of her this episode</div><div class='line' id='LC4507'>was.  She had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph</div><div class='line' id='LC4508'>a procession; but being in doubt, it was just like her to try</div><div class='line' id='LC4509'>to do it with an axe.</div><div class='line' id='LC4510'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4511'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4512'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4513'>CHAPTER XIX</div><div class='line' id='LC4514'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4515'>KNIGHT-ERRANTRY AS A TRADE</div><div class='line' id='LC4516'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4517'>Sandy and I were on the road again, next morning, bright and early.</div><div class='line' id='LC4518'>It was so good to open up one&#39;s lungs and take in whole luscious</div><div class='line' id='LC4519'>barrels-ful of the blessed God&#39;s untainted, dew-fashioned,</div><div class='line' id='LC4520'>woodland-scented air once more, after suffocating body and mind for two</div><div class='line' id='LC4521'>days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable</div><div class='line' id='LC4522'>old buzzard-roost!  I mean, for me: of course the place was all</div><div class='line' id='LC4523'>right and agreeable enough for Sandy, for she had been used to</div><div class='line' id='LC4524'>high life all her days.</div><div class='line' id='LC4525'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4526'>Poor girl, her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while,</div><div class='line' id='LC4527'>and I was expecting to get the consequences.

And so they came into a deep forest,</div><div class='line' id='LC4548'>and by fortune they were nighted, and rode along in a deep way,</div><div class='line' id='LC4549'>and at the last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke</div><div class='line' id='LC4550'>of South Marches, and there they asked harbour.  And on the morn</div><div class='line' id='LC4551'>the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus, and bad him make him ready.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC4552'>so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him, and there was a mass sung</div><div class='line' id='LC4553'>afore him, and he brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in</div><div class='line' id='LC4554'>the court of the castle, there they should do the battle.  So there</div><div class='line' id='LC4555'>was the duke already on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons</div><div class='line' id='LC4556'>by him, and every each had a spear in his hand, and so they</div><div class='line' id='LC4557'>encountered, whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears</div><div class='line' id='LC4558'>upon him, but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of</div><div class='line' id='LC4559'>them.  Then came the four sons by couples, and two of them brake</div><div class='line' id='LC4560'>their spears, and so did the other two.  And all this while</div><div class='line' id='LC4561'>Sir Marhaus touched them not.  Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke,</div><div class='line' id='LC4562'>and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth.</div><div class='line' id='LC4563'>And so he served his sons.  And then Sir Marhaus alight down, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4564'>bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him.  And then some</div><div class='line' id='LC4565'>of his sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir Marhaus.  Then</div><div class='line' id='LC4566'>Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or else I will do</div><div class='line' id='LC4567'>the uttermost to you all.  When the duke saw he might not escape</div><div class='line' id='LC4568'>the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them</div><div class='line' id='LC4569'>to Sir Marhaus.  And they kneeled all down and put the pommels</div><div class='line' id='LC4570'>of their swords to the knight, and so he received them.  And then</div><div class='line' id='LC4571'>they holp up their father, and so by their common assent promised</div><div class='line' id='LC4572'>unto Sir Marhaus never to be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon</div><div class='line' id='LC4573'>at Whitsuntide after, to come he and his sons, and put them in</div><div class='line' id='LC4574'>the king&#39;s grace.*</div><div class='line' id='LC4575'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4576'>[*Footnote: The story is borrowed, language and all, from the</div><div class='line' id='LC4577'>Morte d&#39;Arthur.--M.T.]</div><div class='line' id='LC4578'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4579'>&quot;Even so standeth the history, fair Sir Boss.

However, that aside, it was a good haul,</div><div class='line' id='LC4624'>anyway, and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in Arthur&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4625'>court.  And speaking of the cowboys, what a curious country this</div><div class='line' id='LC4626'>is for women and men that never get old.  Now there&#39;s Morgan le Fay,</div><div class='line' id='LC4627'>as fresh and young as a Vassar pullet, to all appearances, and</div><div class='line' id='LC4628'>here is this old duke of the South Marches still slashing away with</div><div class='line' id='LC4629'>sword and lance at his time of life, after raising such a family</div><div class='line' id='LC4630'>as he has raised.  As I understand it, Sir Gawaine killed seven</div><div class='line' id='LC4631'>of his sons, and still he had six left for Sir Marhaus and me to</div><div class='line' id='LC4632'>take into camp.  And then there was that damsel of sixty winter</div><div class='line' id='LC4633'>of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom--How old</div><div class='line' id='LC4634'>are you, Sandy?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4635'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4636'>It was the first time I ever struck a still place in her.  The mill</div><div class='line' id='LC4637'>had shut down for repairs, or something.</div><div class='line' id='LC4638'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4639'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4640'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4641'>CHAPTER XX</div><div class='line' id='LC4642'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4643'>THE OGRE&#39;S CASTLE</div><div class='line' id='LC4644'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4645'>Between six and nine we made ten miles, which was plenty for a</div><div class='line' id='LC4646'>horse carrying triple--man, woman, and armor; then we stopped</div><div class='line' id='LC4647'>for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook.</div><div class='line' id='LC4648'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4649'>Right so came by and by a knight riding; and as he drew near he</div><div class='line' id='LC4650'>made dolorous moan, and by the words of it I perceived that he</div><div class='line' id='LC4651'>was cursing and swearing; yet nevertheless was I glad of his</div><div class='line' id='LC4652'>coming, for that I saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon in letters</div><div class='line' id='LC4653'>all of shining gold was writ:</div><div class='line' id='LC4654'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4655'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;USE PETERSON&#39;S PROPHYLACTIC TOOTH-BRUSH--ALL THE GO.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4656'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4657'>I was glad of his coming, for even by this token I knew him for</div><div class='line' id='LC4658'>knight of mine.  It was Sir Madok de la Montaine, a burly great</div><div class='line' id='LC4659'>fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace</div><div class='line' id='LC4660'>of sending Sir Launcelot down over his horse-tail once.  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC4661'>never long in a stranger&#39;s presence without finding some pretext</div><div class='line' id='LC4662'>or other to let out that great fact.  But there was another fact</div><div class='line' id='LC4663'>of nearly the same size, which he never pushed upon anybody unasked,</div><div class='line' id='LC4664'>and yet never withheld when asked: that was, that the reason he</div><div class='line' id='LC4665'>didn&#39;t quite succeed was, that he was interrupted and sent down</div><div class='line' id='LC4666'>over horse-tail himself.  This innocent vast lubber did not see</div><div class='line' id='LC4667'>any particular difference between the two facts.  I liked him,</div><div class='line' id='LC4668'>for he was earnest in his work, and very valuable.  And he was so</div><div class='line' id='LC4669'>fine to look at, with his broad mailed shoulders, and the grand</div><div class='line' id='LC4670'>leonine set of his plumed head, and his big shield with its quaint</div><div class='line' id='LC4671'>device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth-brush,</div><div class='line' id='LC4672'>with motto: &quot;Try Noyoudont.&quot;  This was a tooth-wash that I was</div><div class='line' id='LC4673'>introducing.</div><div class='line' id='LC4674'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4675'>He was aweary, he said, and indeed he looked it; but he would not</div><div class='line' id='LC4676'>alight.  He said he was after the stove-polish man; and with this</div><div class='line' id='LC4677'>he broke out cursing and swearing anew.  The bulletin-boarder</div><div class='line' id='LC4678'>referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse, a brave knight, and of</div><div class='line' id='LC4679'>considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions</div><div class='line' id='LC4680'>in a tournament once, with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris</div><div class='line' id='LC4681'>himself--although not successfully.  He was of a light and laughing</div><div class='line' id='LC4682'>disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC4683'>for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove-polish</div><div class='line' id='LC4684'>sentiment.  There were no stoves yet, and so there could be nothing</div><div class='line' id='LC4685'>serious about stove-polish.  All that the agent needed to do was</div><div class='line' id='LC4686'>to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change,</div><div class='line' id='LC4687'>and have them established in predilections toward neatness against</div><div class='line' id='LC4688'>the time when the stove should appear upon the stage.</div><div class='line' id='LC4689'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4690'>Sir Madok was very bitter, and brake out anew with cursings.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC4691'>said he had cursed his soul to rags; and yet he would not get down</div><div class='line' id='LC4692'>from his horse, neither would he take any rest, or listen to any</div><div class='line' id='LC4693'>comfort, until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this</div><div class='line' id='LC4694'>account.  It appeared, by what I could piece together of the</div><div class='line' id='LC4695'>unprofane fragments of his statement, that he had chanced upon</div><div class='line' id='LC4696'>Sir Ossaise at dawn of the morning, and been told that if he would</div><div class='line' id='LC4697'>make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and</div><div class='line' id='LC4698'>glades, he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare</div><div class='line' id='LC4699'>customers for prophylactics and tooth-wash.  With characteristic</div><div class='line' id='LC4700'>zeal Sir Madok had plunged away at once upon this quest, and after</div><div class='line' id='LC4701'>three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC4702'>behold, it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the</div><div class='line' id='LC4703'>dungeons the evening before!  Poor old creatures, it was all of</div><div class='line' id='LC4704'>twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be</div><div class='line' id='LC4705'>equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.</div><div class='line' id='LC4706'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4707'>&quot;Blank-blank-blank him,&quot; said Sir Madok, &quot;an I do not stove-polish</div><div class='line' id='LC4708'>him an I may find him, leave it to me; for never no knight that</div><div class='line' id='LC4709'>hight Ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide</div><div class='line' id='LC4710'>on live, an I may find him, the which I have thereunto sworn a</div><div class='line' id='LC4711'>great oath this day.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4712'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4713'>And with these words and others, he lightly took his spear and</div><div class='line' id='LC4714'>gat him thence.  In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one</div><div class='line' id='LC4715'>of those very patriarchs ourselves, in the edge of a poor village.</div><div class='line' id='LC4716'>He was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not</div><div class='line' id='LC4717'>seen for fifty years; and about him and caressing him were also</div><div class='line' id='LC4718'>descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now;</div><div class='line' id='LC4719'>but to him these were all strangers, his memory was gone, his mind</div><div class='line' id='LC4720'>was stagnant.  It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half</div><div class='line' id='LC4721'>a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat, but here were his old</div><div class='line' id='LC4722'>wife and some old comrades to testify to it.  They could remember</div><div class='line' id='LC4723'>him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood,</div><div class='line' id='LC4724'>when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother&#39;s hands</div><div class='line' id='LC4725'>and went away into that long oblivion.  The people at the castle</div><div class='line' id='LC4726'>could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man</div><div class='line' id='LC4727'>had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense;</div><div class='line' id='LC4728'>but this old wife knew; and so did her old child, who stood there</div><div class='line' id='LC4729'>among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father</div><div class='line' id='LC4730'>who had been to her a name, a thought, a formless image, a tradition,</div><div class='line' id='LC4731'>all her life, and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh</div><div class='line' id='LC4732'>and blood and set before her face.</div><div class='line' id='LC4733'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4734'>It was a curious situation; yet it is not on that account that</div><div class='line' id='LC4735'>I have made room for it here, but on account of a thing which</div><div class='line' id='LC4736'>seemed to me still more curious.  To wit, that this dreadful matter</div><div class='line' id='LC4737'>brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against</div><div class='line' id='LC4738'>these oppressors.  They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty</div><div class='line' id='LC4739'>and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but</div><div class='line' id='LC4740'>a kindness.  Yes, here was a curious revelation, indeed, of the</div><div class='line' id='LC4741'>depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery.  Their entire</div><div class='line' id='LC4742'>being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience, resignation,</div><div class='line' id='LC4743'>dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in</div><div class='line' id='LC4744'>this life.  Their very imagination was dead.  When you can say</div><div class='line' id='LC4745'>that of a man, he has struck bottom, I reckon; there is no lower</div><div class='line' id='LC4746'>deep for him.</div><div class='line' id='LC4747'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4748'>I rather wished I had gone some other road.  This was not the sort</div><div class='line' id='LC4749'>of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out</div><div class='line' id='LC4750'>a peaceful revolution in his mind.  For it could not help bringing</div><div class='line' id='LC4751'>up the unget-aroundable fact that, all gentle cant and philosophizing</div><div class='line' id='LC4752'>to the contrary notwithstanding, no people in the world ever did</div><div class='line' id='LC4753'>achieve their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion:</div><div class='line' id='LC4754'>it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must</div><div class='line' id='LC4755'>_begin_ in blood, whatever may answer afterward.  If history teaches</div><div class='line' id='LC4756'>anything, it teaches that.  What this folk needed, then, was a</div><div class='line' id='LC4757'>Reign of Terror and a guillotine, and I was the wrong man for them.</div><div class='line' id='LC4758'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4759'>Two days later, toward noon, Sandy began to show signs of excitement</div><div class='line' id='LC4760'>and feverish expectancy.  She said we were approaching the ogre&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4761'>castle.  I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock.  The object</div><div class='line' id='LC4762'>of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden</div><div class='line' id='LC4763'>resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing</div><div class='line' id='LC4764'>for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest.  Sandy&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4765'>excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort</div><div class='line' id='LC4766'>of thing is catching.  My heart got to thumping.  You can&#39;t reason</div><div class='line' id='LC4767'>with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which</div><div class='line' id='LC4768'>the intellect scorns.  Presently, when Sandy slid from the horse,</div><div class='line' id='LC4769'>motioned me to stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head</div><div class='line' id='LC4770'>bent nearly to her knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered</div><div class='line' id='LC4771'>a declivity, the thumpings grew stronger and quicker.  And they</div><div class='line' id='LC4772'>kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse</div><div class='line' id='LC4773'>over the declivity; and also while I was creeping to her side on</div><div class='line' id='LC4774'>my knees.  Her eyes were burning now, as she pointed with her</div><div class='line' id='LC4775'>finger, and said in a panting whisper:</div><div class='line' id='LC4776'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4777'>&quot;The castle!  The castle!  Lo, where it looms!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4778'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4779'>What a welcome disappointment I experienced!  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC4780'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4781'>&quot;Castle?  It is nothing but a pigsty; a pigsty with a wattled</div><div class='line' id='LC4782'>fence around it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4783'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4784'>She looked surprised and distressed.  The animation faded out of</div><div class='line' id='LC4785'>her face; and during many moments she was lost in thought and</div><div class='line' id='LC4786'>silent.  Then:</div><div class='line' id='LC4787'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4788'>&quot;It was not enchanted aforetime,&quot; she said in a musing fashion,</div><div class='line' id='LC4789'>as if to herself.  &quot;And how strange is this marvel, and how awful</div><div class='line' id='LC4790'>--that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base</div><div class='line' id='LC4791'>and shameful aspect; yet to the perception of the other it is not</div><div class='line' id='LC4792'>enchanted, hath suffered no change, but stands firm and stately</div><div class='line' id='LC4793'>still, girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air</div><div class='line' id='LC4794'>from its towers.  And God shield us, how it pricks the heart to</div><div class='line' id='LC4795'>see again these gracious captives, and the sorrow deepened in their</div><div class='line' id='LC4796'>sweet faces!  We have tarried along, and are to blame.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4797'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4798'>I saw my cue.  The castle was enchanted to _me_, not to her. It would</div><div class='line' id='LC4799'>be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion, it couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC4800'>be done; I must just humor it.  So I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC4801'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4802'>&quot;This is a common case--the enchanting of a thing to one eye and</div><div class='line' id='LC4803'>leaving it in its proper form to another.  You have heard of it</div><div class='line' id='LC4804'>before, Sandy, though you haven&#39;t happened to experience it.</div><div class='line' id='LC4805'>But no harm is done.  In fact, it is lucky the way it is.  If these</div><div class='line' id='LC4806'>ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves, it would be</div><div class='line' id='LC4807'>necessary to break the enchantment, and that might be impossible</div><div class='line' id='LC4808'>if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment.</div><div class='line' id='LC4809'>And hazardous, too; for in attempting a disenchantment without the</div><div class='line' id='LC4810'>true key, you are liable to err, and turn your hogs into dogs,</div><div class='line' id='LC4811'>and the dogs into cats, the cats into rats, and so on, and end by</div><div class='line' id='LC4812'>reducing your materials to nothing finally, or to an odorless gas</div><div class='line' id='LC4813'>which you can&#39;t follow--which, of course, amounts to the same</div><div class='line' id='LC4814'>thing.  But here, by good luck, no one&#39;s eyes but mine are under</div><div class='line' id='LC4815'>the enchantment, and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it.</div><div class='line' id='LC4816'>These ladies remain ladies to you, and to themselves, and to</div><div class='line' id='LC4817'>everybody else; and at the same time they will suffer in no way</div><div class='line' id='LC4818'>from my delusion, for when I know that an ostensible hog is a</div><div class='line' id='LC4819'>lady, that is enough for me, I know how to treat her.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4820'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4821'>&quot;Thanks, oh, sweet my lord, thou talkest like an angel.  And I know</div><div class='line' id='LC4822'>that thou wilt deliver them, for that thou art minded to great</div><div class='line' id='LC4823'>deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will</div><div class='line' id='LC4824'>and to do, as any that is on live.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4825'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4826'>&quot;I will not leave a princess in the sty, Sandy.  Are those three</div><div class='line' id='LC4827'>yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine-herds--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4828'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4829'>&quot;The ogres, Are _they_ changed also?  It is most wonderful.  Now</div><div class='line' id='LC4830'>am I fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of</div><div class='line' id='LC4831'>their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible?  Ah, go warily,</div><div class='line' id='LC4832'>fair sir; this is a mightier emprise than I wend.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4833'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4834'>&quot;You be easy, Sandy.  All I need to know is, how _much_ of an ogre</div><div class='line' id='LC4835'>is invisible; then I know how to locate his vitals.  Don&#39;t you be</div><div class='line' id='LC4836'>afraid, I will make short work of these bunco-steerers.  Stay</div><div class='line' id='LC4837'>where you are.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4838'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4839'>I left Sandy kneeling there, corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful,</div><div class='line' id='LC4840'>and rode down to the pigsty, and struck up a trade with the</div><div class='line' id='LC4841'>swine-herds.  I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs</div><div class='line' id='LC4842'>at the lump sum of sixteen pennies, which was rather above latest</div><div class='line' id='LC4843'>quotations.  I was just in time; for the Church, the lord of the</div><div class='line' id='LC4844'>manor, and the rest of the tax-gatherers would have been along</div><div class='line' id='LC4845'>next day and swept off pretty much all the stock, leaving the</div><div class='line' id='LC4846'>swine-herds very short of hogs and Sandy out of princesses.  But</div><div class='line' id='LC4847'>now the tax people could be paid in cash, and there would be</div><div class='line' id='LC4848'>a stake left besides.  One of the men had ten children; and he</div><div class='line' id='LC4849'>said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took</div><div class='line' id='LC4850'>the fattest one for tithes, the wife burst out upon him, and offered</div><div class='line' id='LC4851'>him a child and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC4852'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4853'>&quot;Thou beast without bowels of mercy, why leave me my child, yet</div><div class='line' id='LC4854'>rob me of the wherewithal to feed it?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4855'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4856'>How curious.  The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day,</div><div class='line' id='LC4857'>under this same old Established Church, which was supposed by many</div><div class='line' id='LC4858'>to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise.</div><div class='line' id='LC4859'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4860'>I sent the three men away, and then opened the sty gate and beckoned</div><div class='line' id='LC4861'>Sandy to come--which she did; and not leisurely, but with the rush</div><div class='line' id='LC4862'>of a prairie fire.  And when I saw her fling herself upon those</div><div class='line' id='LC4863'>hogs, with tears of joy running down her cheeks, and strain them</div><div class='line' id='LC4864'>to her heart, and kiss them, and caress them, and call them</div><div class='line' id='LC4865'>reverently by grand princely names, I was ashamed of her, ashamed</div><div class='line' id='LC4866'>of the human race.</div><div class='line' id='LC4867'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4868'>We had to drive those hogs home--ten miles; and no ladies were</div><div class='line' id='LC4869'>ever more fickle-minded or contrary.  They would stay in no road,</div><div class='line' id='LC4870'>no path; they broke out through the brush on all sides, and flowed</div><div class='line' id='LC4871'>away in all directions, over rocks, and hills, and the roughest</div><div class='line' id='LC4872'>places they could find.  And they must not be struck, or roughly</div><div class='line' id='LC4873'>accosted; Sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming</div><div class='line' id='LC4874'>their rank.  The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called</div><div class='line' id='LC4875'>my Lady, and your Highness, like the rest.  It is annoying and</div><div class='line' id='LC4876'>difficult to scour around after hogs, in armor.  There was one</div><div class='line' id='LC4877'>small countess, with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair</div><div class='line' id='LC4878'>on her back, that was the devil for perversity.  She gave me a race</div><div class='line' id='LC4879'>of an hour, over all sorts of country, and then we were right where</div><div class='line' id='LC4880'>we had started from, having made not a rod of real progress.</div><div class='line' id='LC4881'>I seized her at last by the tail, and brought her along squealing.</div><div class='line' id='LC4882'>When I overtook Sandy she was horrified, and said it was in the</div><div class='line' id='LC4883'>last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train.</div><div class='line' id='LC4884'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4885'>We got the hogs home just at dark--most of them.  The princess</div><div class='line' id='LC4886'>Nerovens de Morganore was missing, and two of her ladies in waiting:</div><div class='line' id='LC4887'>namely, Miss Angela Bohun, and the Demoiselle Elaine Courtemains,</div><div class='line' id='LC4888'>the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star</div><div class='line' id='LC4889'>in her forehead, and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a</div><div class='line' id='LC4890'>slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side--a couple</div><div class='line' id='LC4891'>of the tryingest blisters to drive that I ever saw.  Also among</div><div class='line' id='LC4892'>the missing were several mere baronesses--and I wanted them to</div><div class='line' id='LC4893'>stay missing; but no, all that sausage-meat had to be found; so</div><div class='line' id='LC4894'>servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills</div><div class='line' id='LC4895'>to that end.</div><div class='line' id='LC4896'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4897'>Of course, the whole drove was housed in the house, and, great</div><div class='line' id='LC4898'>guns!--well, I never saw anything like it.  Nor ever heard anything</div><div class='line' id='LC4899'>like it.  And never smelt anything like it.  It was like an</div><div class='line' id='LC4900'>insurrection in a gasometer.</div><div class='line' id='LC4901'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4902'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4903'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4904'>CHAPTER XXI</div><div class='line' id='LC4905'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4906'>THE PILGRIMS</div><div class='line' id='LC4907'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4908'>When I did get to bed at last I was unspeakably tired; the stretching</div><div class='line' id='LC4909'>out, and the relaxing of the long-tense muscles, how luxurious,</div><div class='line' id='LC4910'>how delicious! but that was as far as I could get--sleep was out of</div><div class='line' id='LC4911'>the question for the present.  The ripping and tearing and squealing</div><div class='line' id='LC4912'>of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium</div><div class='line' id='LC4913'>come again, and kept me broad awake.  Being awake, my thoughts</div><div class='line' id='LC4914'>were busy, of course; and mainly they busied themselves with Sandy&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4915'>curious delusion.  Here she was, as sane a person as the kingdom</div><div class='line' id='LC4916'>could produce; and yet, from my point of view she was acting like</div><div class='line' id='LC4917'>a crazy woman.  My land, the power of training! of influence!</div><div class='line' id='LC4918'>of education!  It can bring a body up to believe anything.  I had</div><div class='line' id='LC4919'>to put myself in Sandy&#39;s place to realize that she was not a</div><div class='line' id='LC4920'>lunatic.  Yes, and put her in mine, to demonstrate how easy it is</div><div class='line' id='LC4921'>to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have</div><div class='line' id='LC4922'>been taught.  If I had told Sandy I had seen a wagon, uninfluenced</div><div class='line' id='LC4923'>by enchantment, spin along fifty miles an hour; had seen a man,</div><div class='line' id='LC4924'>unequipped with magic powers, get into a basket and soar out of</div><div class='line' id='LC4925'>sight among the clouds; and had listened, without any necromancer&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC4926'>help, to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles</div><div class='line' id='LC4927'>away, Sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy, she</div><div class='line' id='LC4928'>would have thought she knew it.  Everybody around her believed in</div><div class='line' id='LC4929'>enchantments; nobody had any doubts; to doubt that a castle could</div><div class='line' id='LC4930'>be turned into a sty, and its occupants into hogs, would have been</div><div class='line' id='LC4931'>the same as my doubting among Connecticut people the actuality</div><div class='line' id='LC4932'>of the telephone and its wonders,--and in both cases would be</div><div class='line' id='LC4933'>absolute proof of a diseased mind, an unsettled reason.  Yes, Sandy</div><div class='line' id='LC4934'>was sane; that must be admitted.  If I also would be sane--to Sandy</div><div class='line' id='LC4935'>--I must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous</div><div class='line' id='LC4936'>locomotives, balloons, and telephones, to myself.  Also, I believed</div><div class='line' id='LC4937'>that the world was not flat, and hadn&#39;t pillars under it to support</div><div class='line' id='LC4938'>it, nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that</div><div class='line' id='LC4939'>occupied all space above; but as I was the only person in the kingdom</div><div class='line' id='LC4940'>afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions, I recognized</div><div class='line' id='LC4941'>that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter, too,</div><div class='line' id='LC4942'>if I did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC4943'>as a madman.</div><div class='line' id='LC4944'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4945'>The next morning Sandy assembled the swine in the dining-room and</div><div class='line' id='LC4946'>gave them their breakfast, waiting upon them personally and</div><div class='line' id='LC4947'>manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of</div><div class='line' id='LC4948'>her island, ancient and modern, have always felt for rank, let its</div><div class='line' id='LC4949'>outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may.</div><div class='line' id='LC4950'>I could have eaten with the hogs if I had had birth approaching my</div><div class='line' id='LC4951'>lofty official rank; but I hadn&#39;t, and so accepted the unavoidable</div><div class='line' id='LC4952'>slight and made no complaint.  Sandy and I had our breakfast at</div><div class='line' id='LC4953'>the second table.  The family were not at home.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC4954'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4955'>&quot;How many are in the family, Sandy, and where do they keep themselves?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4956'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4957'>&quot;Family?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4958'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4959'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4960'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4961'>&quot;Which family, good my lord?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4962'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4963'>&quot;Why, this family; your own family.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4964'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4965'>&quot;Sooth to say, I understand you not.  I have no family.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4966'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4967'>&quot;No family?  Why, Sandy, isn&#39;t this your home?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4968'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4969'>&quot;Now how indeed might that be?  I have no home.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4970'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4971'>&quot;Well, then, whose house is this?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4972'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4973'>&quot;Ah, wit you well I would tell you an I knew myself.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4974'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4975'>&quot;Come--you don&#39;t even know these people?  Then who invited us here?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4976'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4977'>&quot;None invited us.  We but came; that is all.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4978'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4979'>&quot;Why, woman, this is a most extraordinary performance.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC4980'>effrontery of it is beyond admiration.  We blandly march into</div><div class='line' id='LC4981'>a man&#39;s house, and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility</div><div class='line' id='LC4982'>the sun has yet discovered in the earth, and then it turns out</div><div class='line' id='LC4983'>that we don&#39;t even know the man&#39;s name.  How did you ever venture</div><div class='line' id='LC4984'>to take this extravagant liberty?  I supposed, of course, it was</div><div class='line' id='LC4985'>your home.  What will the man say?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4986'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4987'>&quot;What will he say?  Forsooth what can he say but give thanks?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4988'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4989'>&quot;Thanks for what?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4990'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4991'>Her face was filled with a puzzled surprise:</div><div class='line' id='LC4992'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4993'>&quot;Verily, thou troublest mine understanding with strange words.</div><div class='line' id='LC4994'>Do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice</div><div class='line' id='LC4995'>in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace</div><div class='line' id='LC4996'>his house withal?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC4997'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC4998'>&quot;Well, no--when you come to that.

A departure from</div><div class='line' id='LC5072'>custom--that settled it; it was a nation capable of committing any</div><div class='line' id='LC5073'>crime but that.  The servants said they would follow the fashion,</div><div class='line' id='LC5074'>a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance; they would</div><div class='line' id='LC5075'>scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls, and then the</div><div class='line' id='LC5076'>evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible.</div><div class='line' id='LC5077'>It was a kind of satire on Nature: it was the scientific method,</div><div class='line' id='LC5078'>the geologic method; it deposited the history of the family in</div><div class='line' id='LC5079'>a stratified record; and the antiquary could dig through it and</div><div class='line' id='LC5080'>tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family</div><div class='line' id='LC5081'>had introduced successively for a hundred years.</div><div class='line' id='LC5082'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5083'>The first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims.</div><div class='line' id='LC5084'>It was not going our way, but we joined it, nevertheless; for it</div><div class='line' id='LC5085'>was hourly being borne in upon me now, that if I would govern</div><div class='line' id='LC5086'>this country wisely, I must be posted in the details of its life,</div><div class='line' id='LC5087'>and not at second hand, but by personal observation and scrutiny.</div><div class='line' id='LC5088'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5089'>This company of pilgrims resembled Chaucer&#39;s in this: that it</div><div class='line' id='LC5090'>had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions</div><div class='line' id='LC5091'>the country could show, and a corresponding variety of costume.</div><div class='line' id='LC5092'>There were young men and old men, young women and old women,</div><div class='line' id='LC5093'>lively folk and grave folk.

Is it a celebrated place?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5123'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5124'>&quot;Oh, of a truth, yes.  There be none more so.  Of old time there</div><div class='line' id='LC5125'>lived there an abbot and his monks.

Right so came they</div><div class='line' id='LC5131'>to be known of all the world by reason of these holy austerities,</div><div class='line' id='LC5132'>and visited by rich and poor, and reverenced.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5133'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5134'>&quot;Proceed.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5135'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5136'>&quot;But always there was lack of water there.  Whereas, upon a time,</div><div class='line' id='LC5137'>the holy abbot prayed, and for answer a great stream of clear</div><div class='line' id='LC5138'>water burst forth by miracle in a desert place.  Now were the</div><div class='line' id='LC5139'>fickle monks tempted of the Fiend, and they wrought with their</div><div class='line' id='LC5140'>abbot unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct</div><div class='line' id='LC5141'>a bath; and when he was become aweary and might not resist more,</div><div class='line' id='LC5142'>he said have ye your will, then, and granted that they asked.</div><div class='line' id='LC5143'>Now mark thou what &#39;tis to forsake the ways of purity the which</div><div class='line' id='LC5144'>He loveth, and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense.</div><div class='line' id='LC5145'>These monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as</div><div class='line' id='LC5146'>white as snow; and lo, in that moment His sign appeared, in</div><div class='line' id='LC5147'>miraculous rebuke! for His insulted waters ceased to flow, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5148'>utterly vanished away.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5149'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5150'>&quot;They fared mildly, Sandy, considering how that kind of crime</div><div class='line' id='LC5151'>is regarded in this country.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5152'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5153'>&quot;Belike; but it was their first sin; and they had been of perfect</div><div class='line' id='LC5154'>life for long, and differing in naught from the angels.  Prayers,</div><div class='line' id='LC5155'>tears, torturings of the flesh, all was vain to beguile that water</div><div class='line' id='LC5156'>to flow again.  Even processions; even burnt-offerings; even votive</div><div class='line' id='LC5157'>candles to the Virgin, did fail every each of them; and all in</div><div class='line' id='LC5158'>the land did marvel.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5159'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5160'>&quot;How odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics,</div><div class='line' id='LC5161'>and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero,</div><div class='line' id='LC5162'>and everything come to a standstill.  Go on, Sandy.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5163'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5164'>&quot;And so upon a time, after year and day, the good abbot made humble</div><div class='line' id='LC5165'>surrender and destroyed the bath.  And behold, His anger was in that</div><div class='line' id='LC5166'>moment appeased, and the waters gushed richly forth again, and even</div><div class='line' id='LC5167'>unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5168'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5169'>&quot;Then I take it nobody has washed since.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5170'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5171'>&quot;He that would essay it could have his halter free; yes, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5172'>swiftly would he need it, too.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5173'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5174'>&quot;The community has prospered since?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5175'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5176'>&quot;Even from that very day.  The fame of the miracle went abroad</div><div class='line' id='LC5177'>into all lands.  From every land came monks to join; they came</div><div class='line' id='LC5178'>even as the fishes come, in shoals; and the monastery added building</div><div class='line' id='LC5179'>to building, and yet others to these, and so spread wide its arms</div><div class='line' id='LC5180'>and took them in.  And nuns came, also; and more again, and yet</div><div class='line' id='LC5181'>more; and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the</div><div class='line' id='LC5182'>vale, and added building to building, until mighty was that nunnery.</div><div class='line' id='LC5183'>And these were friendly unto those, and they joined their loving</div><div class='line' id='LC5184'>labors together, and together they built a fair great foundling</div><div class='line' id='LC5185'>asylum midway of the valley between.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5186'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5187'>&quot;You spoke of some hermits, Sandy.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5188'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5189'>&quot;These have gathered there from the ends of the earth.  A hermit</div><div class='line' id='LC5190'>thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims.  Ye shall not</div><div class='line' id='LC5191'>find no hermit of no sort wanting.  If any shall mention a hermit</div><div class='line' id='LC5192'>of a kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far</div><div class='line' id='LC5193'>strange land, let him but scratch among the holes and caves and</div><div class='line' id='LC5194'>swamps that line that Valley of Holiness, and whatsoever be his</div><div class='line' id='LC5195'>breed, it skills not, he shall find a sample of it there.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5196'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5197'>I closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good-humored</div><div class='line' id='LC5198'>face, purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further</div><div class='line' id='LC5199'>crumbs of fact; but I had hardly more than scraped acquaintance</div><div class='line' id='LC5200'>with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up, in the</div><div class='line' id='LC5201'>immemorial way, to that same old anecdote--the one Sir Dinadan</div><div class='line' id='LC5202'>told me, what time I got into trouble with Sir Sagramor and was</div><div class='line' id='LC5203'>challenged of him on account of it.  I excused myself and dropped</div><div class='line' id='LC5204'>to the rear of the procession, sad at heart, willing to go hence</div><div class='line' id='LC5205'>from this troubled life, this vale of tears, this brief day of</div><div class='line' id='LC5206'>broken rest, of cloud and storm, of weary struggle and monotonous</div><div class='line' id='LC5207'>defeat; and yet shrinking from the change, as remembering how long</div><div class='line' id='LC5208'>eternity is, and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote.</div><div class='line' id='LC5209'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5210'>Early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims;</div><div class='line' id='LC5211'>but in this one was no merriment, no jokes, no laughter, no playful</div><div class='line' id='LC5212'>ways, nor any happy giddiness, whether of youth or age.  Yet both</div><div class='line' id='LC5213'>were here, both age and youth; gray old men and women, strong men</div><div class='line' id='LC5214'>and women of middle age, young husbands, young wives, little boys</div><div class='line' id='LC5215'>and girls, and three babies at the breast.  Even the children were</div><div class='line' id='LC5216'>smileless; there was not a face among all these half a hundred</div><div class='line' id='LC5217'>people but was cast down, and bore that set expression of hopelessness</div><div class='line' id='LC5218'>which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with</div><div class='line' id='LC5219'>despair.  They were slaves.  Chains led from their fettered feet</div><div class='line' id='LC5220'>and their manacled hands to a sole-leather belt about their waists;</div><div class='line' id='LC5221'>and all except the children were also linked together in a file</div><div class='line' id='LC5222'>six feet apart, by a single chain which led from collar to collar</div><div class='line' id='LC5223'>all down the line.  They were on foot, and had tramped three</div><div class='line' id='LC5224'>hundred miles in eighteen days, upon the cheapest odds and ends</div><div class='line' id='LC5225'>of food, and stingy rations of that.  They had slept in these</div><div class='line' id='LC5226'>chains every night, bundled together like swine.  They had upon</div><div class='line' id='LC5227'>their bodies some poor rags, but they could not be said to be</div><div class='line' id='LC5228'>clothed.  Their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and</div><div class='line' id='LC5229'>made sores which were ulcerated and wormy.  Their naked feet were</div><div class='line' id='LC5230'>torn, and none walked without a limp.  Originally there had been a</div><div class='line' id='LC5231'>hundred of these unfortunates, but about half had been sold on</div><div class='line' id='LC5232'>the trip.  The trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried</div><div class='line' id='LC5233'>a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into</div><div class='line' id='LC5234'>several knotted tails at the end.  With this whip he cut the</div><div class='line' id='LC5235'>shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5236'>straightened them up.  He did not speak; the whip conveyed his</div><div class='line' id='LC5237'>desire without that.  None of these poor creatures looked up as</div><div class='line' id='LC5238'>we rode along by; they showed no consciousness of our presence.</div><div class='line' id='LC5239'>And they made no sound but one; that was the dull and awful clank</div><div class='line' id='LC5240'>of their chains from end to end of the long file, as forty-three</div><div class='line' id='LC5241'>burdened feet rose and fell in unison.  The file moved in a cloud</div><div class='line' id='LC5242'>of its own making.</div><div class='line' id='LC5243'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5244'>All these faces were gray with a coating of dust.  One has seen</div><div class='line' id='LC5245'>the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5246'>has written his idle thought in it with his finger.  I was reminded</div><div class='line' id='LC5247'>of this when I noticed the faces of some of those women, young</div><div class='line' id='LC5248'>mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom, how</div><div class='line' id='LC5249'>a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their</div><div class='line' id='LC5250'>faces, plain to see, and lord, how plain to read! for it was the</div><div class='line' id='LC5251'>track of tears.  One of these young mothers was but a girl, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5252'>it hurt me to the heart to read that writing, and reflect that it</div><div class='line' id='LC5253'>was come up out of the breast of such a child, a breast that ought</div><div class='line' id='LC5254'>not to know trouble yet, but only the gladness of the morning of</div><div class='line' id='LC5255'>life; and no doubt--</div><div class='line' id='LC5256'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5257'>She reeled just then, giddy with fatigue, and down came the lash</div><div class='line' id='LC5258'>and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder.  It stung me</div><div class='line' id='LC5259'>as if I had been hit instead.  The master halted the file and</div><div class='line' id='LC5260'>jumped from his horse.  He stormed and swore at this girl, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5261'>said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness, and as this</div><div class='line' id='LC5262'>was the last chance he should have, he would settle the account now.</div><div class='line' id='LC5263'>She dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg,</div><div class='line' id='LC5264'>and cry, and implore, in a passion of terror, but the master gave</div><div class='line' id='LC5265'>no attention.  He snatched the child from her, and then made the</div><div class='line' id='LC5266'>men-slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on</div><div class='line' id='LC5267'>the ground and hold her there and expose her body; and then he</div><div class='line' id='LC5268'>laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed, she</div><div class='line' id='LC5269'>shrieking and struggling the while piteously.  One of the men who</div><div class='line' id='LC5270'>was holding her turned away his face, and for this humanity he was</div><div class='line' id='LC5271'>reviled and flogged.</div><div class='line' id='LC5272'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5273'>All our pilgrims looked on and commented--on the expert way in</div><div class='line' id='LC5274'>which the whip was handled.  They were too much hardened by lifelong</div><div class='line' id='LC5275'>everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything</div><div class='line' id='LC5276'>else in the exhibition that invited comment.  This was what slavery</div><div class='line' id='LC5277'>could do, in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior</div><div class='line' id='LC5278'>lobe of human feeling; for these pilgrims were kind-hearted people,</div><div class='line' id='LC5279'>and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that.</div><div class='line' id='LC5280'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5281'>I wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free, but that</div><div class='line' id='LC5282'>would not do.  I must not interfere too much and get myself a name</div><div class='line' id='LC5283'>for riding over the country&#39;s laws and the citizen&#39;s rights</div><div class='line' id='LC5284'>roughshod.  If I lived and prospered I would be the death of</div><div class='line' id='LC5285'>slavery, that I was resolved upon; but I would try to fix it so</div><div class='line' id='LC5286'>that when I became its executioner it should be by command of</div><div class='line' id='LC5287'>the nation.</div><div class='line' id='LC5288'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5289'>Just here was the wayside shop of a smith; and now arrived a landed</div><div class='line' id='LC5290'>proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back, deliverable</div><div class='line' id='LC5291'>here where her irons could be taken off.  They were removed; then</div><div class='line' id='LC5292'>there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to</div><div class='line' id='LC5293'>which should pay the blacksmith.  The moment the girl was delivered</div><div class='line' id='LC5294'>from her irons, she flung herself, all tears and frantic sobbings,</div><div class='line' id='LC5295'>into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she</div><div class='line' id='LC5296'>was whipped.  He strained her to his breast, and smothered her</div><div class='line' id='LC5297'>face and the child&#39;s with kisses, and washed them with the rain</div><div class='line' id='LC5298'>of his tears.  I suspected.  I inquired.  Yes, I was right; it was</div><div class='line' id='LC5299'>husband and wife.  They had to be torn apart by force; the girl</div><div class='line' id='LC5300'>had to be dragged away, and she struggled and fought and shrieked</div><div class='line' id='LC5301'>like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight; and</div><div class='line' id='LC5302'>even after that, we could still make out the fading plaint of those</div><div class='line' id='LC5303'>receding shrieks.  And the husband and father, with his wife and</div><div class='line' id='LC5304'>child gone, never to be seen by him again in life?--well, the look</div><div class='line' id='LC5305'>of him one might not bear at all, and so I turned away; but I knew</div><div class='line' id='LC5306'>I should never get his picture out of my mind again, and there</div><div class='line' id='LC5307'>it is to this day, to wring my heartstrings whenever I think of it.</div><div class='line' id='LC5308'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5309'>We put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall, and when</div><div class='line' id='LC5310'>I rose next morning and looked abroad, I was ware where a knight</div><div class='line' id='LC5311'>came riding in the golden glory of the new day, and recognized him</div><div class='line' id='LC5312'>for knight of mine--Sir Ozana le Cure Hardy.  He was in the</div><div class='line' id='LC5313'>gentlemen&#39;s furnishing line, and his missionarying specialty was</div><div class='line' id='LC5314'>plug hats.  He was clothed all in steel, in the beautifulest armor</div><div class='line' id='LC5315'>of the time--up to where his helmet ought to have been; but he</div><div class='line' id='LC5316'>hadn&#39;t any helmet, he wore a shiny stove-pipe hat, and was ridiculous</div><div class='line' id='LC5317'>a spectacle as one might want to see.  It was another of my</div><div class='line' id='LC5318'>surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it</div><div class='line' id='LC5319'>grotesque and absurd.  Sir Ozana&#39;s saddle was hung about with</div><div class='line' id='LC5320'>leather hat boxes, and every time he overcame a wandering knight</div><div class='line' id='LC5321'>he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made</div><div class='line' id='LC5322'>him wear it.  I dressed and ran down to welcome Sir Ozana and</div><div class='line' id='LC5323'>get his news.</div><div class='line' id='LC5324'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5325'>&quot;How is trade?&quot; I asked.</div><div class='line' id='LC5326'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5327'>&quot;Ye will note that I have but these four left; yet were they sixteen</div><div class='line' id='LC5328'>whenas I got me from Camelot.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5329'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5330'>&quot;Why, you have certainly done nobly, Sir Ozana.

Give him good feed,</div><div class='line' id='LC5339'>boy, and stint it not, an thou valuest thy crown; so get ye lightly</div><div class='line' id='LC5340'>to the stable and do even as I bid....  Sir, it is parlous news</div><div class='line' id='LC5341'>I bring, and--be these pilgrims?  Then ye may not do better, good</div><div class='line' id='LC5342'>folk, than gather and hear the tale I have to tell, sith it</div><div class='line' id='LC5343'>concerneth you, forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find,</div><div class='line' id='LC5344'>and seek that ye will seek in vain, my life being hostage for my</div><div class='line' id='LC5345'>word, and my word and message being these, namely: That a hap</div><div class='line' id='LC5346'>has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once</div><div class='line' id='LC5347'>this two hundred years, which was the first and last time that</div><div class='line' id='LC5348'>that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by</div><div class='line' id='LC5349'>commandment of the Most High whereto by reasons just and causes</div><div class='line' id='LC5350'>thereunto contributing, wherein the matter--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5351'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5352'>&quot;The miraculous fount hath ceased to flow!&quot;  This shout burst from</div><div class='line' id='LC5353'>twenty pilgrim mouths at once.</div><div class='line' id='LC5354'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5355'>&quot;Ye say well, good people.  I was verging to it, even when ye spake.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5356'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5357'>&quot;Has somebody been washing again?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5358'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5359'>&quot;Nay, it is suspected, but none believe it.

The fount is these nine days dry.</div><div class='line' id='LC5365'>The prayers that did begin then, and the lamentations in sackcloth</div><div class='line' id='LC5366'>and ashes, and the holy processions, none of these have ceased</div><div class='line' id='LC5367'>nor night nor day; and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings</div><div class='line' id='LC5368'>be all exhausted, and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment,</div><div class='line' id='LC5369'>sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice.  And at last</div><div class='line' id='LC5370'>they sent for thee, Sir Boss, to try magic and enchantment; and</div><div class='line' id='LC5371'>if you could not come, then was the messenger to fetch Merlin,</div><div class='line' id='LC5372'>and he is there these three days now, and saith he will fetch that</div><div class='line' id='LC5373'>water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish</div><div class='line' id='LC5374'>it; and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his</div><div class='line' id='LC5375'>hellions to hie them hither and help, but not a whiff of moisture</div><div class='line' id='LC5376'>hath he started yet, even so much as might qualify as mist upon</div><div class='line' id='LC5377'>a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth</div><div class='line' id='LC5378'>betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task; and if ye--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5379'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5380'>Breakfast was ready.

That is, its</div><div class='line' id='LC5411'>large features.  These were the three masses of buildings.  They</div><div class='line' id='LC5412'>were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions</div><div class='line' id='LC5413'>in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert--and was.  Such a scene</div><div class='line' id='LC5414'>is always mournful, it is so impressively still, and looks so</div><div class='line' id='LC5415'>steeped in death.  But there was a sound here which interrupted</div><div class='line' id='LC5416'>the stillness only to add to its mournfulness; this was the faint</div><div class='line' id='LC5417'>far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the</div><div class='line' id='LC5418'>passing breeze, and so faintly, so softly, that we hardly knew</div><div class='line' id='LC5419'>whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits.</div><div class='line' id='LC5420'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5421'>We reached the monastery before dark, and there the males were</div><div class='line' id='LC5422'>given lodging, but the women were sent over to the nunnery.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC5423'>bells were close at hand now, and their solemn booming smote</div><div class='line' id='LC5424'>upon the ear like a message of doom.  A superstitious despair</div><div class='line' id='LC5425'>possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his</div><div class='line' id='LC5426'>ghastly face.  Everywhere, these black-robed, soft-sandaled,</div><div class='line' id='LC5427'>tallow-visaged specters appeared, flitted about and disappeared,</div><div class='line' id='LC5428'>noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream, and as uncanny.</div><div class='line' id='LC5429'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5430'>The old abbot&#39;s joy to see me was pathetic.

And see thou do it with enchantments</div><div class='line' id='LC5436'>that be holy, for the Church will not endure that work in her cause</div><div class='line' id='LC5437'>be done by devil&#39;s magic.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5438'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5439'>&quot;When I work, Father, be sure there will be no devil&#39;s work</div><div class='line' id='LC5440'>connected with it.  I shall use no arts that come of the devil,</div><div class='line' id='LC5441'>and no elements not created by the hand of God.  But is Merlin</div><div class='line' id='LC5442'>working strictly on pious lines?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5443'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5444'>&quot;Ah, he said he would, my son, he said he would, and took oath</div><div class='line' id='LC5445'>to make his promise good.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5446'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5447'>&quot;Well, in that case, let him proceed.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5448'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5449'>&quot;But surely you will not sit idle by, but help?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5450'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5451'>&quot;It will not answer to mix methods, Father; neither would it be</div><div class='line' id='LC5452'>professional courtesy.  Two of a trade must not underbid each</div><div class='line' id='LC5453'>other.  We might as well cut rates and be done with it; it would</div><div class='line' id='LC5454'>arrive at that in the end.  Merlin has the contract; no other</div><div class='line' id='LC5455'>magician can touch it till he throws it up.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5456'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5457'>&quot;But I will take it from him; it is a terrible emergency and the</div><div class='line' id='LC5458'>act is thereby justified.  And if it were not so, who will give</div><div class='line' id='LC5459'>law to the Church?  The Church giveth law to all; and what she</div><div class='line' id='LC5460'>wills to do, that she may do, hurt whom it may.  I will take it</div><div class='line' id='LC5461'>from him; you shall begin upon the moment.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5462'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5463'>&quot;It may not be, Father.  No doubt, as you say, where power is</div><div class='line' id='LC5464'>supreme, one can do as one likes and suffer no injury; but we poor</div><div class='line' id='LC5465'>magicians are not so situated.  Merlin is a very good magician</div><div class='line' id='LC5466'>in a small way, and has quite a neat provincial reputation.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC5467'>is struggling along, doing the best he can, and it would not be</div><div class='line' id='LC5468'>etiquette for me to take his job until he himself abandons it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5469'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5470'>The abbot&#39;s face lighted.</div><div class='line' id='LC5471'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5472'>&quot;Ah, that is simple.  There are ways to persuade him to abandon it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5473'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5474'>&quot;No-no, Father, it skills not, as these people say.  If he were</div><div class='line' id='LC5475'>persuaded against his will, he would load that well with a malicious</div><div class='line' id='LC5476'>enchantment which would balk me until I found out its secret.</div><div class='line' id='LC5477'>It might take a month.  I could set up a little enchantment of</div><div class='line' id='LC5478'>mine which I call the telephone, and he could not find out its</div><div class='line' id='LC5479'>secret in a hundred years.  Yes, you perceive, he might block me</div><div class='line' id='LC5480'>for a month.  Would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5481'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5482'>&quot;A month!  The mere thought of it maketh me to shudder.  Have it</div><div class='line' id='LC5483'>thy way, my son.  But my heart is heavy with this disappointment.</div><div class='line' id='LC5484'>Leave me, and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting,</div><div class='line' id='LC5485'>even as I have done these ten long days, counterfeiting thus</div><div class='line' id='LC5486'>the thing that is called rest, the prone body making outward sign</div><div class='line' id='LC5487'>of repose where inwardly is none.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5488'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5489'>Of course, it would have been best, all round, for Merlin to waive</div><div class='line' id='LC5490'>etiquette and quit and call it half a day, since he would never be</div><div class='line' id='LC5491'>able to start that water, for he was a true magician of the time;</div><div class='line' id='LC5492'>which is to say, the big miracles, the ones that gave him his</div><div class='line' id='LC5493'>reputation, always had the luck to be performed when nobody but</div><div class='line' id='LC5494'>Merlin was present; he couldn&#39;t start this well with all this crowd</div><div class='line' id='LC5495'>around to see; a crowd was as bad for a magician&#39;s miracle in</div><div class='line' id='LC5496'>that day as it was for a spiritualist&#39;s miracle in mine; there was</div><div class='line' id='LC5497'>sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial</div><div class='line' id='LC5498'>moment and spoil everything.  But I did not want Merlin to retire</div><div class='line' id='LC5499'>from the job until I was ready to take hold of it effectively</div><div class='line' id='LC5500'>myself; and I could not do that until I got my things from Camelot,</div><div class='line' id='LC5501'>and that would take two or three days.</div><div class='line' id='LC5502'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5503'>My presence gave the monks hope, and cheered them up a good deal;</div><div class='line' id='LC5504'>insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time</div><div class='line' id='LC5505'>in ten days.  As soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced</div><div class='line' id='LC5506'>with food, their spirits began to rise fast; when the mead began to</div><div class='line' id='LC5507'>go round they rose faster.  By the time everybody was half-seas over,</div><div class='line' id='LC5508'>the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it; so we</div><div class='line' id='LC5509'>stayed by the board and put it through on that line.  Matters got</div><div class='line' id='LC5510'>to be very jolly.  Good old questionable stories were told that made</div><div class='line' id='LC5511'>the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round</div><div class='line' id='LC5512'>bellies shake with laughter; and questionable songs were bellowed out</div><div class='line' id='LC5513'>in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells.</div><div class='line' id='LC5514'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5515'>At last I ventured a story myself; and vast was the success of it.</div><div class='line' id='LC5516'>Not right off, of course, for the native of those islands does</div><div class='line' id='LC5517'>not, as a rule, dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous</div><div class='line' id='LC5518'>thing; but the fifth time I told it, they began to crack in places;</div><div class='line' id='LC5519'>the eight time I told it, they began to crumble; at the twelfth</div><div class='line' id='LC5520'>repetition they fell apart in chunks; and at the fifteenth they</div><div class='line' id='LC5521'>disintegrated, and I got a broom and swept them up.  This language</div><div class='line' id='LC5522'>is figurative.  Those islanders--well, they are slow pay at first,</div><div class='line' id='LC5523'>in the matter of return for your investment of effort, but in the end</div><div class='line' id='LC5524'>they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast.</div><div class='line' id='LC5525'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5526'>I was at the well next day betimes.  Merlin was there, enchanting</div><div class='line' id='LC5527'>away like a beaver, but not raising the moisture.  He was not in</div><div class='line' id='LC5528'>a pleasant humor; and every time I hinted that perhaps this contract</div><div class='line' id='LC5529'>was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and</div><div class='line' id='LC5530'>cursed like a bishop--French bishop of the Regency days, I mean.</div><div class='line' id='LC5531'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5532'>Matters were about as I expected to find them.  The &quot;fountain&quot; was</div><div class='line' id='LC5533'>an ordinary well, it had been dug in the ordinary way, and stoned up</div><div class='line' id='LC5534'>in the ordinary way.  There was no miracle about it.  Even the lie</div><div class='line' id='LC5535'>that had created its reputation was not miraculous; I could have</div><div class='line' id='LC5536'>told it myself, with one hand tied behind me.  The well was in a</div><div class='line' id='LC5537'>dark chamber which stood in the center of a cut-stone chapel, whose</div><div class='line' id='LC5538'>walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would</div><div class='line' id='LC5539'>have made a chromo feel good; pictures historically commemorative</div><div class='line' id='LC5540'>of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when</div><div class='line' id='LC5541'>nobody was looking.  That is, nobody but angels; they are always</div><div class='line' id='LC5542'>on deck when there is a miracle to the fore--so as to get put in</div><div class='line' id='LC5543'>the picture, perhaps.  Angels are as fond of that as a fire company;</div><div class='line' id='LC5544'>look at the old masters.</div><div class='line' id='LC5545'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5546'>The well-chamber was dimly lighted by lamps; the water was drawn</div><div class='line' id='LC5547'>with a windlass and chain by monks, and poured into troughs which</div><div class='line' id='LC5548'>delivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapel--when</div><div class='line' id='LC5549'>there was water to draw, I mean--and none but monks could enter</div><div class='line' id='LC5550'>the well-chamber.  I entered it, for I had temporary authority</div><div class='line' id='LC5551'>to do so, by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate.</div><div class='line' id='LC5552'>But he hadn&#39;t entered it himself.  He did everything by incantations;</div><div class='line' id='LC5553'>he never worked his intellect.  If he had stepped in there and used</div><div class='line' id='LC5554'>his eyes, instead of his disordered mind, he could have cured</div><div class='line' id='LC5555'>the well by natural means, and then turned it into a miracle in</div><div class='line' id='LC5556'>the customary way; but no, he was an old numskull, a magician who</div><div class='line' id='LC5557'>believed in his own magic; and no magician can thrive who is</div><div class='line' id='LC5558'>handicapped with a superstition like that.</div><div class='line' id='LC5559'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5560'>I had an idea that the well had sprung a leak; that some of the</div><div class='line' id='LC5561'>wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that</div><div class='line' id='LC5562'>allowed the water to escape.  I measured the chain--98 feet.  Then</div><div class='line' id='LC5563'>I called in a couple of monks, locked the door, took a candle, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5564'>made them lower me in the bucket.  When the chain was all paid out,</div><div class='line' id='LC5565'>the candle confirmed my suspicion; a considerable section of the</div><div class='line' id='LC5566'>wall was gone, exposing a good big fissure.</div><div class='line' id='LC5567'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5568'>I almost regretted that my theory about the well&#39;s trouble was</div><div class='line' id='LC5569'>correct, because I had another one that had a showy point or two</div><div class='line' id='LC5570'>about it for a miracle.  I remembered that in America, many</div><div class='line' id='LC5571'>centuries later, when an oil well ceased to flow, they used to</div><div class='line' id='LC5572'>blast it out with a dynamite torpedo.  If I should find this well</div><div class='line' id='LC5573'>dry and no explanation of it, I could astonish these people most</div><div class='line' id='LC5574'>nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite</div><div class='line' id='LC5575'>bomb into it.  It was my idea to appoint Merlin.  However, it was</div><div class='line' id='LC5576'>plain that there was no occasion for the bomb.  One cannot have</div><div class='line' id='LC5577'>everything the way he would like it.  A man has no business to</div><div class='line' id='LC5578'>be depressed by a disappointment, anyway; he ought to make up his</div><div class='line' id='LC5579'>mind to get even.  That is what I did.  I said to myself, I am in no</div><div class='line' id='LC5580'>hurry, I can wait; that bomb will come good yet.  And it did, too.</div><div class='line' id='LC5581'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5582'>When I was above ground again, I turned out the monks, and let down</div><div class='line' id='LC5583'>a fish-line; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep, and there</div><div class='line' id='LC5584'>was forty-one feet of water in it.  I called in a monk and asked:</div><div class='line' id='LC5585'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5586'>&quot;How deep is the well?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5587'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5588'>&quot;That, sir, I wit not, having never been told.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5589'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5590'>&quot;How does the water usually stand in it?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5591'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5592'>&quot;Near to the top, these two centuries, as the testimony goeth,</div><div class='line' id='LC5593'>brought down to us through our predecessors.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5594'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5595'>It was true--as to recent times at least--for there was witness</div><div class='line' id='LC5596'>to it, and better witness than a monk; only about twenty or thirty</div><div class='line' id='LC5597'>feet of the chain showed wear and use, the rest of it was unworn</div><div class='line' id='LC5598'>and rusty.  What had happened when the well gave out that other</div><div class='line' id='LC5599'>time?  Without doubt some practical person had come along and</div><div class='line' id='LC5600'>mended the leak, and then had come up and told the abbot he had</div><div class='line' id='LC5601'>discovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed</div><div class='line' id='LC5602'>the well would flow again.  The leak had befallen again now, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5603'>these children would have prayed, and processioned, and tolled</div><div class='line' id='LC5604'>their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew</div><div class='line' id='LC5605'>away, and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop</div><div class='line' id='LC5606'>a fish-line into the well or go down in it and find out what was</div><div class='line' id='LC5607'>really the matter.  Old habit of mind is one of the toughest things</div><div class='line' id='LC5608'>to get away from in the world.  It transmits itself like physical</div><div class='line' id='LC5609'>form and feature; and for a man, in those days, to have had an idea</div><div class='line' id='LC5610'>that his ancestors hadn&#39;t had, would have brought him under suspicion</div><div class='line' id='LC5611'>of being illegitimate.  I said to the monk:</div><div class='line' id='LC5612'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5613'>&quot;It is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well, but we</div><div class='line' id='LC5614'>will try, if my brother Merlin fails.  Brother Merlin is a very</div><div class='line' id='LC5615'>passable artist, but only in the parlor-magic line, and he may</div><div class='line' id='LC5616'>not succeed; in fact, is not likely to succeed.  But that should</div><div class='line' id='LC5617'>be nothing to his discredit; the man that can do _this_ kind of</div><div class='line' id='LC5618'>miracle knows enough to keep hotel.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5619'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5620'>&quot;Hotel?  I mind not to have heard--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5621'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5622'>&quot;Of hotel?  It&#39;s what you call hostel.  The man that can do this</div><div class='line' id='LC5623'>miracle can keep hostel.  I can do this miracle; I shall do this</div><div class='line' id='LC5624'>miracle; yet I do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle</div><div class='line' id='LC5625'>to tax the occult powers to the last strain.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5626'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5627'>&quot;None knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood, indeed; for</div><div class='line' id='LC5628'>it is of record that aforetime it was parlous difficult and took</div><div class='line' id='LC5629'>a year.  Natheless, God send you good success, and to that end</div><div class='line' id='LC5630'>will we pray.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5631'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5632'>As a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around</div><div class='line' id='LC5633'>that the thing was difficult.  Many a small thing has been made</div><div class='line' id='LC5634'>large by the right kind of advertising.  That monk was filled up</div><div class='line' id='LC5635'>with the difficulty of this enterprise; he would fill up the others.</div><div class='line' id='LC5636'>In two days the solicitude would be booming.</div><div class='line' id='LC5637'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5638'>On my way home at noon, I met Sandy.

She had exactly the</div><div class='line' id='LC5712'>German way; whatever was in her mind to be delivered, whether a</div><div class='line' id='LC5713'>mere remark, or a sermon, or a cyclopedia, or the history of a war,</div><div class='line' id='LC5714'>she would get it into a single sentence or die.  Whenever the literary</div><div class='line' id='LC5715'>German dives into a sentence, that is the last you are going to see</div><div class='line' id='LC5716'>of him till he emerges on the other side of his Atlantic with his</div><div class='line' id='LC5717'>verb in his mouth.</div><div class='line' id='LC5718'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5719'>We drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon.  It was a most</div><div class='line' id='LC5720'>strange menagerie.  The chief emulation among them seemed to be,</div><div class='line' id='LC5721'>to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous</div><div class='line' id='LC5722'>with vermin.  Their manner and attitudes were the last expression</div><div class='line' id='LC5723'>of complacent self-righteousness.  It was one anchorite&#39;s pride</div><div class='line' id='LC5724'>to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister</div><div class='line' id='LC5725'>him unmolested; it was another&#39;s to lean against a rock, all day</div><div class='line' id='LC5726'>long, conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims</div><div class='line' id='LC5727'>and pray; it was another&#39;s to go naked and crawl around on all fours;</div><div class='line' id='LC5728'>it was another&#39;s to drag about with him, year in and year out,</div><div class='line' id='LC5729'>eighty pounds of iron; it was another&#39;s to never lie down when</div><div class='line' id='LC5730'>he slept, but to stand among the thorn-bushes and snore when there</div><div class='line' id='LC5731'>were pilgrims around to look; a woman, who had the white hair of</div><div class='line' id='LC5732'>age, and no other apparel, was black from crown to heel with</div><div class='line' id='LC5733'>forty-seven years of holy abstinence from water.  Groups of gazing</div><div class='line' id='LC5734'>pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects, lost</div><div class='line' id='LC5735'>in reverent wonder, and envious of the fleckless sanctity which</div><div class='line' id='LC5736'>these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven.</div><div class='line' id='LC5737'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5738'>By and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones.  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC5739'>a mighty celebrity; his fame had penetrated all Christendom; the</div><div class='line' id='LC5740'>noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe</div><div class='line' id='LC5741'>to pay him reverence.  His stand was in the center of the widest part</div><div class='line' id='LC5742'>of the valley; and it took all that space to hold his crowds.</div><div class='line' id='LC5743'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5744'>His stand was a pillar sixty feet high, with a broad platform on</div><div class='line' id='LC5745'>the top of it.  He was now doing what he had been doing every day</div><div class='line' id='LC5746'>for twenty years up there--bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly</div><div class='line' id='LC5747'>almost to his feet.  It was his way of praying.  I timed him with a</div><div class='line' id='LC5748'>stop watch, and he made 1,244 revolutions in 24 minutes and</div><div class='line' id='LC5749'>46 seconds.  It seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste.</div><div class='line' id='LC5750'>It was one of the most useful motions in mechanics, the pedal</div><div class='line' id='LC5751'>movement; so I made a note in my memorandum book, purposing some</div><div class='line' id='LC5752'>day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing</div><div class='line' id='LC5753'>machine with it.  I afterward carried out that scheme, and got</div><div class='line' id='LC5754'>five years&#39; good service out of him; in which time he turned out</div><div class='line' id='LC5755'>upward of eighteen thousand first-rate tow-linen shirts, which</div><div class='line' id='LC5756'>was ten a day.  I worked him Sundays and all; he was going, Sundays,</div><div class='line' id='LC5757'>the same as week days, and it was no use to waste the power.</div><div class='line' id='LC5758'>These shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the</div><div class='line' id='LC5759'>materials--I furnished those myself, it would not have been right</div><div class='line' id='LC5760'>to make him do that--and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a</div><div class='line' id='LC5761'>dollar and a half apiece, which was the price of fifty cows or</div><div class='line' id='LC5762'>a blooded race horse in Arthurdom.  They were regarded as a perfect</div><div class='line' id='LC5763'>protection against sin, and advertised as such by my knights</div><div class='line' id='LC5764'>everywhere, with the paint-pot and stencil-plate; insomuch that</div><div class='line' id='LC5765'>there was not a cliff or a bowlder or a dead wall in England but</div><div class='line' id='LC5766'>you could read on it at a mile distance:</div><div class='line' id='LC5767'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5768'>&quot;Buy the only genuine St. Stylite; patronized by the Nobility.</div><div class='line' id='LC5769'>Patent applied for.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5770'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5771'>There was more money in the business than one knew what to do with.</div><div class='line' id='LC5772'>As it extended, I brought out a line of goods suitable for kings,</div><div class='line' id='LC5773'>and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort, with ruffles down</div><div class='line' id='LC5774'>the forehatch and the running-gear clewed up with a featherstitch</div><div class='line' id='LC5775'>to leeward and then hauled aft with a back-stay and triced up with</div><div class='line' id='LC5776'>a half-turn in the standing rigging forward of the weather-gaskets.</div><div class='line' id='LC5777'>Yes, it was a daisy.</div><div class='line' id='LC5778'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5779'>But about that time I noticed that the motive power had taken to</div><div class='line' id='LC5780'>standing on one leg, and I found that there was something the matter</div><div class='line' id='LC5781'>with the other one; so I stocked the business and unloaded, taking</div><div class='line' id='LC5782'>Sir Bors de Ganis into camp financially along with certain of his</div><div class='line' id='LC5783'>friends; for the works stopped within a year, and the good saint</div><div class='line' id='LC5784'>got him to his rest.

Merlin</div><div class='line' id='LC5802'>was still burning smoke-powders, and pawing the air, and muttering</div><div class='line' id='LC5803'>gibberish as hard as ever, but looking pretty down-hearted, for</div><div class='line' id='LC5804'>of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet.</div><div class='line' id='LC5805'>Finally I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC5806'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5807'>&quot;How does the thing promise by this time, partner?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5808'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5809'>&quot;Behold, I am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest</div><div class='line' id='LC5810'>enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands</div><div class='line' id='LC5811'>of the East; an it fail me, naught can avail.  Peace, until I finish.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5812'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5813'>He raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region, and must</div><div class='line' id='LC5814'>have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits, for the wind</div><div class='line' id='LC5815'>was their way, and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and</div><div class='line' id='LC5816'>billowy fog.  He poured out volumes of speech to match, and contorted</div><div class='line' id='LC5817'>his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary</div><div class='line' id='LC5818'>way.  At the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5819'>about exhausted.  Now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks</div><div class='line' id='LC5820'>and nuns, and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of</div><div class='line' id='LC5821'>acres of foundlings, all drawn by the prodigious smoke, and all</div><div class='line' id='LC5822'>in a grand state of excitement.  The abbot inquired anxiously for</div><div class='line' id='LC5823'>results.  Merlin said:</div><div class='line' id='LC5824'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5825'>&quot;If any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these</div><div class='line' id='LC5826'>waters, this which I have but just essayed had done it.  It has</div><div class='line' id='LC5827'>failed; whereby I do now know that that which I had feared is</div><div class='line' id='LC5828'>a truth established; the sign of this failure is, that the most</div><div class='line' id='LC5829'>potent spirit known to the magicians of the East, and whose name</div><div class='line' id='LC5830'>none may utter and live, has laid his spell upon this well.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC5831'>mortal does not breathe, nor ever will, who can penetrate the secret</div><div class='line' id='LC5832'>of that spell, and without that secret none can break it.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC5833'>water will flow no more forever, good Father.  I have done what</div><div class='line' id='LC5834'>man could.  Suffer me to go.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5835'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5836'>Of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation.</div><div class='line' id='LC5837'>He turned to me with the signs of it in his face, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC5838'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5839'>&quot;Ye have heard him.

Why certainly.  I would utter it if it was Welsh.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5895'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5896'>&quot;Ye are even a dead man, then; and I go to tell Arthur.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5897'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5898'>&quot;That&#39;s all right.  Take your gripsack and get along.  The thing</div><div class='line' id='LC5899'>for _you_ to do is to go home and work the weather, John W. Merlin.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC5900'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5901'>It was a home shot, and it made him wince; for he was the worst</div><div class='line' id='LC5902'>weather-failure in the kingdom.  Whenever he ordered up the</div><div class='line' id='LC5903'>danger-signals along the coast there was a week&#39;s dead calm, sure,</div><div class='line' id='LC5904'>and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats.</div><div class='line' id='LC5905'>But I kept him in the weather bureau right along, to undermine</div><div class='line' id='LC5906'>his reputation.  However, that shot raised his bile, and instead</div><div class='line' id='LC5907'>of starting home to report my death, he said he would remain</div><div class='line' id='LC5908'>and enjoy it.</div><div class='line' id='LC5909'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5910'>My two experts arrived in the evening, and pretty well fagged,</div><div class='line' id='LC5911'>for they had traveled double tides.  They had pack-mules along,</div><div class='line' id='LC5912'>and had brought everything I needed--tools, pump, lead pipe,</div><div class='line' id='LC5913'>Greek fire, sheaves of big rockets, roman candles, colored fire</div><div class='line' id='LC5914'>sprays, electric apparatus, and a lot of sundries--everything</div><div class='line' id='LC5915'>necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle.  They got their</div><div class='line' id='LC5916'>supper and a nap, and about midnight we sallied out through a</div><div class='line' id='LC5917'>solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed</div><div class='line' id='LC5918'>the required conditions.  We took possession of the well and its</div><div class='line' id='LC5919'>surroundings.  My boys were experts in all sorts of things, from</div><div class='line' id='LC5920'>the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical</div><div class='line' id='LC5921'>instrument.  An hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in</div><div class='line' id='LC5922'>ship-shape fashion, and the water began to rise.  Then we stowed our</div><div class='line' id='LC5923'>fireworks in the chapel, locked up the place, and went home to bed.</div><div class='line' id='LC5924'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5925'>Before the noon mass was over, we were at the well again; for there</div><div class='line' id='LC5926'>was a deal to do yet, and I was determined to spring the miracle</div><div class='line' id='LC5927'>before midnight, for business reasons: for whereas a miracle</div><div class='line' id='LC5928'>worked for the Church on a week-day is worth a good deal, it is</div><div class='line' id='LC5929'>worth six times as much if you get it in on a Sunday.  In nine hours</div><div class='line' id='LC5930'>the water had risen to its customary level--that is to say, it was</div><div class='line' id='LC5931'>within twenty-three feet of the top.  We put in a little iron pump,</div><div class='line' id='LC5932'>one of the first turned out by my works near the capital; we bored</div><div class='line' id='LC5933'>into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the</div><div class='line' id='LC5934'>well-chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long</div><div class='line' id='LC5935'>enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond</div><div class='line' id='LC5936'>the threshold, where the gushing water would be visible to the</div><div class='line' id='LC5937'>two hundred and fifty acres of people I was intending should be</div><div class='line' id='LC5938'>present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at</div><div class='line' id='LC5939'>the proper time.</div><div class='line' id='LC5940'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5941'>We knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this</div><div class='line' id='LC5942'>hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel, where we clamped it down</div><div class='line' id='LC5943'>fast, poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the</div><div class='line' id='LC5944'>bottom, then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they</div><div class='line' id='LC5945'>could loosely stand, all the different breeds of rockets there are;</div><div class='line' id='LC5946'>and they made a portly and imposing sheaf, I can tell you.  We</div><div class='line' id='LC5947'>grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder,</div><div class='line' id='LC5948'>we placed a whole magazine of Greek fire on each corner of the</div><div class='line' id='LC5949'>roof--blue on one corner, green on another, red on another, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5950'>purple on the last--and grounded a wire in each.</div><div class='line' id='LC5951'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5952'>About two hundred yards off, in the flat, we built a pen of</div><div class='line' id='LC5953'>scantlings, about four feet high, and laid planks on it, and so</div><div class='line' id='LC5954'>made a platform.  We covered it with swell tapestries borrowed</div><div class='line' id='LC5955'>for the occasion, and topped it off with the abbot&#39;s own throne.</div><div class='line' id='LC5956'>When you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race, you want</div><div class='line' id='LC5957'>to get in every detail that will count; you want to make all the</div><div class='line' id='LC5958'>properties impressive to the public eye; you want to make matters</div><div class='line' id='LC5959'>comfortable for your head guest; then you can turn yourself loose</div><div class='line' id='LC5960'>and play your effects for all they are worth.  I know the value of</div><div class='line' id='LC5961'>these things, for I know human nature.  You can&#39;t throw too much</div><div class='line' id='LC5962'>style into a miracle.  It costs trouble, and work, and sometimes</div><div class='line' id='LC5963'>money; but it pays in the end.  Well, we brought the wires to</div><div class='line' id='LC5964'>the ground at the chapel, and then brought them under the ground</div><div class='line' id='LC5965'>to the platform, and hid the batteries there.  We put a rope fence</div><div class='line' id='LC5966'>a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common</div><div class='line' id='LC5967'>multitude, and that finished the work.  My idea was, doors open</div><div class='line' id='LC5968'>at 10:30, performance to begin at 11:25 sharp.  I wished I could</div><div class='line' id='LC5969'>charge admission, but of course that wouldn&#39;t answer.  I instructed</div><div class='line' id='LC5970'>my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10, before anybody was</div><div class='line' id='LC5971'>around, and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time, and</div><div class='line' id='LC5972'>make the fur fly.  Then we went home to supper.</div><div class='line' id='LC5973'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5974'>The news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time;</div><div class='line' id='LC5975'>and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had</div><div class='line' id='LC5976'>been pouring into the valley.  The lower end of the valley was</div><div class='line' id='LC5977'>become one huge camp; we should have a good house, no question</div><div class='line' id='LC5978'>about that.  Criers went the rounds early in the evening and</div><div class='line' id='LC5979'>announced the coming attempt, which put every pulse up to fever</div><div class='line' id='LC5980'>heat.  They gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would</div><div class='line' id='LC5981'>move in state and occupy the platform at 10:30, up to which time</div><div class='line' id='LC5982'>all the region which was under my ban must be clear; the bells</div><div class='line' id='LC5983'>would then cease from tolling, and this sign should be permission</div><div class='line' id='LC5984'>to the multitudes to close in and take their places.</div><div class='line' id='LC5985'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5986'>I was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the</div><div class='line' id='LC5987'>abbot&#39;s solemn procession hove in sight--which it did not do till</div><div class='line' id='LC5988'>it was nearly to the rope fence, because it was a starless black</div><div class='line' id='LC5989'>night and no torches permitted.  With it came Merlin, and took</div><div class='line' id='LC5990'>a front seat on the platform; he was as good as his word for once.</div><div class='line' id='LC5991'>One could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban,</div><div class='line' id='LC5992'>but they were there, just the same.  The moment the bells stopped,</div><div class='line' id='LC5993'>those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast</div><div class='line' id='LC5994'>black wave, and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow,</div><div class='line' id='LC5995'>and then it solidified itself, and you could have walked upon</div><div class='line' id='LC5996'>a pavement of human heads to--well, miles.</div><div class='line' id='LC5997'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC5998'>We had a solemn stage-wait, now, for about twenty minutes--a thing</div><div class='line' id='LC5999'>I had counted on for effect; it is always good to let your audience</div><div class='line' id='LC6000'>have a chance to work up its expectancy.  At length, out of the</div><div class='line' id='LC6001'>silence a noble Latin chant--men&#39;s voices--broke and swelled up</div><div class='line' id='LC6002'>and rolled away into the night, a majestic tide of melody.  I had</div><div class='line' id='LC6003'>put that up, too, and it was one of the best effects I ever invented.</div><div class='line' id='LC6004'>When it was finished I stood up on the platform and extended my</div><div class='line' id='LC6005'>hands abroad, for two minutes, with my face uplifted--that always</div><div class='line' id='LC6006'>produces a dead hush--and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word</div><div class='line' id='LC6007'>with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble, and</div><div class='line' id='LC6008'>many women to faint:</div><div class='line' id='LC6009'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6010'>&quot;Constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6011'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6012'>Just as I was moaning out the closing hunks of that word, I touched</div><div class='line' id='LC6013'>off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of</div><div class='line' id='LC6014'>people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare!  It was immense</div><div class='line' id='LC6015'>--that effect!  Lots of people shrieked, women curled up and quit</div><div class='line' id='LC6016'>in every direction, foundlings collapsed by platoons.  The abbot</div><div class='line' id='LC6017'>and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered</div><div class='line' id='LC6018'>with agitated prayers.  Merlin held his grip, but he was astonished</div><div class='line' id='LC6019'>clear down to his corns; he had never seen anything to begin</div><div class='line' id='LC6020'>with that, before.  Now was the time to pile in the effects.  I lifted</div><div class='line' id='LC6021'>my hands and groaned out this word--as it were in agony:</div><div class='line' id='LC6022'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6023'>&quot;Nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6024'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6025'>--and turned on the red fire!  You should have heard that Atlantic</div><div class='line' id='LC6026'>of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue!</div><div class='line' id='LC6027'>After sixty seconds I shouted:</div><div class='line' id='LC6028'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6029'>&quot;Transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenen-</div><div class='line' id='LC6030'>tragoedie!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6031'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6032'>--and lit up the green fire!  After waiting only forty seconds this</div><div class='line' id='LC6033'>time, I spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating</div><div class='line' id='LC6034'>syllables of this word of words:</div><div class='line' id='LC6035'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6036'>&quot;Mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6037'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6038'>--and whirled on the purple glare!  There they were, all going</div><div class='line' id='LC6039'>at once, red, blue, green, purple!--four furious volcanoes pouring</div><div class='line' id='LC6040'>vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft, and spreading a blinding</div><div class='line' id='LC6041'>rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley.  In</div><div class='line' id='LC6042'>the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid</div><div class='line' id='LC6043'>against the background of sky, his seesaw stopped for the first</div><div class='line' id='LC6044'>time in twenty years.  I knew the boys were at the pump now and</div><div class='line' id='LC6045'>ready.  So I said to the abbot:</div><div class='line' id='LC6046'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6047'>&quot;The time is come, Father.  I am about to pronounce the dread name</div><div class='line' id='LC6048'>and command the spell to dissolve.

The old abbot could not speak a word, for tears and the</div><div class='line' id='LC6072'>chokings in his throat; without utterance of any sort, he folded me</div><div class='line' id='LC6073'>in his arms and mashed me.  It was more eloquent than speech.</div><div class='line' id='LC6074'>And harder to get over, too, in a country where there were really</div><div class='line' id='LC6075'>no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel.</div><div class='line' id='LC6076'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6077'>You should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down</div><div class='line' id='LC6078'>in that water and kiss it; kiss it, and pet it, and fondle it, and</div><div class='line' id='LC6079'>talk to it as if it were alive, and welcome it back with the dear</div><div class='line' id='LC6080'>names they gave their darlings, just as if it had been a friend who</div><div class='line' id='LC6081'>was long gone away and lost, and was come home again.  Yes, it was</div><div class='line' id='LC6082'>pretty to see, and made me think more of them than I had done before.</div><div class='line' id='LC6083'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6084'>I sent Merlin home on a shutter.  He had caved in and gone down</div><div class='line' id='LC6085'>like a landslide when I pronounced that fearful name, and had</div><div class='line' id='LC6086'>never come to since.  He never had heard that name before,--neither</div><div class='line' id='LC6087'>had I--but to him it was the right one.  Any jumble would have</div><div class='line' id='LC6088'>been the right one.  He admitted, afterward, that that spirit&#39;s own</div><div class='line' id='LC6089'>mother could not have pronounced that name better than I did.</div><div class='line' id='LC6090'>He never could understand how I survived it, and I didn&#39;t tell</div><div class='line' id='LC6091'>him.  It is only young magicians that give away a secret like that.</div><div class='line' id='LC6092'>Merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out</div><div class='line' id='LC6093'>the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it.</div><div class='line' id='LC6094'>But he didn&#39;t arrive.</div><div class='line' id='LC6095'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6096'>When I started to the chapel, the populace uncovered and fell back</div><div class='line' id='LC6097'>reverently to make a wide way for me, as if I had been some kind</div><div class='line' id='LC6098'>of a superior being--and I was.  I was aware of that.  I took along</div><div class='line' id='LC6099'>a night shift of monks, and taught them the mystery of the pump,</div><div class='line' id='LC6100'>and set them to work, for it was plain that a good part of the</div><div class='line' id='LC6101'>people out there were going to sit up with the water all night,</div><div class='line' id='LC6102'>consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted</div><div class='line' id='LC6103'>of it.  To those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle</div><div class='line' id='LC6104'>itself, and they were full of wonder over it; and of admiration,</div><div class='line' id='LC6105'>too, of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance.</div><div class='line' id='LC6106'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6107'>It was a great night, an immense night.  There was reputation in it.</div><div class='line' id='LC6108'>I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it.</div><div class='line' id='LC6109'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6110'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6111'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6112'>CHAPTER XXIV</div><div class='line' id='LC6113'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6114'>A RIVAL MAGICIAN</div><div class='line' id='LC6115'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6116'>My influence in the Valley of Holiness was something prodigious</div><div class='line' id='LC6117'>now.  It seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable</div><div class='line' id='LC6118'>account.  The thought came to me the next morning, and was suggested</div><div class='line' id='LC6119'>by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come</div><div class='line' id='LC6120'>riding in.  According to history, the monks of this place two</div><div class='line' id='LC6121'>centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash.</div><div class='line' id='LC6122'>It might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still</div><div class='line' id='LC6123'>remaining.  So I sounded a Brother:</div><div class='line' id='LC6124'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6125'>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like a bath?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6126'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6127'>He shuddered at the thought--the thought of the peril of it to</div><div class='line' id='LC6128'>the well--but he said with feeling:</div><div class='line' id='LC6129'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6130'>&quot;One needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that</div><div class='line' id='LC6131'>blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy.  Would God I might</div><div class='line' id='LC6132'>wash me! but it may not be, fair sir, tempt me not; it is forbidden.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6133'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6134'>And then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that I was resolved</div><div class='line' id='LC6135'>he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed,</div><div class='line' id='LC6136'>if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile.  So I</div><div class='line' id='LC6137'>went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this Brother.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC6138'>blenched at the idea--I don&#39;t mean that you could see him blench,</div><div class='line' id='LC6139'>for of course you couldn&#39;t see it without you scraped him, and</div><div class='line' id='LC6140'>I didn&#39;t care enough about it to scrape him, but I knew the blench</div><div class='line' id='LC6141'>was there, just the same, and within a book-cover&#39;s thickness of</div><div class='line' id='LC6142'>the surface, too--blenched, and trembled.  He said:</div><div class='line' id='LC6143'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6144'>&quot;Ah, son, ask aught else thou wilt, and it is thine, and freely</div><div class='line' id='LC6145'>granted out of a grateful heart--but this, oh, this!  Would you</div><div class='line' id='LC6146'>drive away the blessed water again?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6147'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6148'>&quot;No, Father, I will not drive it away.  I have mysterious knowledge</div><div class='line' id='LC6149'>which teaches me that there was an error that other time when</div><div class='line' id='LC6150'>it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6151'>A large interest began to show up in the old man&#39;s face.  &quot;My</div><div class='line' id='LC6152'>knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune,</div><div class='line' id='LC6153'>which was caused by quite another sort of sin.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6154'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6155'>&quot;These are brave words--but--but right welcome, if they be true.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6156'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6157'>&quot;They are true, indeed.  Let me build the bath again, Father.</div><div class='line' id='LC6158'>Let me build it again, and the fountain shall flow forever.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6159'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6160'>&quot;You promise this?--you promise it?  Say the word--say you promise it!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6161'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6162'>&quot;I do promise it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6163'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6164'>&quot;Then will I have the first bath myself!  Go--get ye to your work.</div><div class='line' id='LC6165'>Tarry not, tarry not, but go.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6166'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6167'>I and my boys were at work, straight off.  The ruins of the old</div><div class='line' id='LC6168'>bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery, not a stone</div><div class='line' id='LC6169'>missing.  They had been left just so, all these lifetimes, and</div><div class='line' id='LC6170'>avoided with a pious fear, as things accursed.  In two days we</div><div class='line' id='LC6171'>had it all done and the water in--a spacious pool of clear pure</div><div class='line' id='LC6172'>water that a body could swim in.  It was running water, too.</div><div class='line' id='LC6173'>It came in, and went out, through the ancient pipes.  The old abbot</div><div class='line' id='LC6174'>kept his word, and was the first to try it.  He went down black</div><div class='line' id='LC6175'>and shaky, leaving the whole black community above troubled and</div><div class='line' id='LC6176'>worried and full of bodings; but he came back white and joyful,</div><div class='line' id='LC6177'>and the game was made! another triumph scored.</div><div class='line' id='LC6178'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6179'>It was a good campaign that we made in that Valley of Holiness,</div><div class='line' id='LC6180'>and I was very well satisfied, and ready to move on now, but</div><div class='line' id='LC6181'>I struck a disappointment.  I caught a heavy cold, and it started</div><div class='line' id='LC6182'>up an old lurking rheumatism of mine.  Of course the rheumatism</div><div class='line' id='LC6183'>hunted up my weakest place and located itself there.  This was</div><div class='line' id='LC6184'>the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me, what</div><div class='line' id='LC6185'>time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace.</div><div class='line' id='LC6186'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6187'>When at last I got out, I was a shadow.  But everybody was full</div><div class='line' id='LC6188'>of attentions and kindnesses, and these brought cheer back into</div><div class='line' id='LC6189'>my life, and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly</div><div class='line' id='LC6190'>up toward health and strength again; so I gained fast.</div><div class='line' id='LC6191'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6192'>Sandy was worn out with nursing; so I made up my mind to turn out</div><div class='line' id='LC6193'>and go a cruise alone, leaving her at the nunnery to rest up.</div><div class='line' id='LC6194'>My idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree</div><div class='line' id='LC6195'>and wander through the country a week or two on foot.  This would</div><div class='line' id='LC6196'>give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest</div><div class='line' id='LC6197'>class of free citizens on equal terms.  There was no other way</div><div class='line' id='LC6198'>to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation</div><div class='line' id='LC6199'>of the laws upon it.  If I went among them as a gentleman, there</div><div class='line' id='LC6200'>would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out</div><div class='line' id='LC6201'>from their private joys and troubles, and I should get no further</div><div class='line' id='LC6202'>than the outside shell.</div><div class='line' id='LC6203'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6204'>One morning I was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip,</div><div class='line' id='LC6205'>and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity</div><div class='line' id='LC6206'>of the valley, when I came upon an artificial opening in the face</div><div class='line' id='LC6207'>of a low precipice, and recognized it by its location as a hermitage</div><div class='line' id='LC6208'>which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den</div><div class='line' id='LC6209'>of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity.  I knew he had</div><div class='line' id='LC6210'>lately been offered a situation in the Great Sahara, where lions</div><div class='line' id='LC6211'>and sandflies made the hermit-life peculiarly attractive and</div><div class='line' id='LC6212'>difficult, and had gone to Africa to take possession, so I thought</div><div class='line' id='LC6213'>I would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed</div><div class='line' id='LC6214'>with its reputation.</div><div class='line' id='LC6215'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6216'>My surprise was great: the place was newly swept and scoured.</div><div class='line' id='LC6217'>Then there was another surprise.  Back in the gloom of the cavern</div><div class='line' id='LC6218'>I heard the clink of a little bell, and then this exclamation:</div><div class='line' id='LC6219'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6220'>&quot;Hello Central!

Confound a telephone, anyway.  It is the very</div><div class='line' id='LC6274'>demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of</div><div class='line' id='LC6275'>divergence from similarity of sense.  But no matter, you know</div><div class='line' id='LC6276'>the name of the place now.

In this atmosphere of telephones and lightning</div><div class='line' id='LC6340'>communication with distant regions, I was breathing the breath</div><div class='line' id='LC6341'>of life again after long suffocation.  I realized, then, what a</div><div class='line' id='LC6342'>creepy, dull, inanimate horror this land had been to me all these</div><div class='line' id='LC6343'>years, and how I had been in such a stifled condition of mind as</div><div class='line' id='LC6344'>to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it.</div><div class='line' id='LC6345'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6346'>I gave my order to the superintendent of the Academy personally.</div><div class='line' id='LC6347'>I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and</div><div class='line' id='LC6348'>a box or so of safety matches.  I was getting tired of doing</div><div class='line' id='LC6349'>without these conveniences.  I could have them now, as I wasn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC6350'>going to wear armor any more at present, and therefore could get</div><div class='line' id='LC6351'>at my pockets.</div><div class='line' id='LC6352'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6353'>When I got back to the monastery, I found a thing of interest</div><div class='line' id='LC6354'>going on.  The abbot and his monks were assembled in the great</div><div class='line' id='LC6355'>hall, observing with childish wonder and faith the performances</div><div class='line' id='LC6356'>of a new magician, a fresh arrival.  His dress was the extreme of</div><div class='line' id='LC6357'>the fantastic; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an Indian</div><div class='line' id='LC6358'>medicine-man wears.  He was mowing, and mumbling, and gesticulating,</div><div class='line' id='LC6359'>and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor,--the</div><div class='line' id='LC6360'>regular thing, you know.  He was a celebrity from Asia--so he</div><div class='line' id='LC6361'>said, and that was enough.  That sort of evidence was as good</div><div class='line' id='LC6362'>as gold, and passed current everywhere.</div><div class='line' id='LC6363'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6364'>How easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellow&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC6365'>terms.  His specialty was to tell you what any individual on the</div><div class='line' id='LC6366'>face of the globe was doing at the moment; and what he had done</div><div class='line' id='LC6367'>at any time in the past, and what he would do at any time in the</div><div class='line' id='LC6368'>future.  He asked if any would like to know what the Emperor of</div><div class='line' id='LC6369'>the East was doing now?  The sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing</div><div class='line' id='LC6370'>of hands made eloquent answer--this reverend crowd _would_ like to</div><div class='line' id='LC6371'>know what that monarch was at, just as this moment.  The fraud</div><div class='line' id='LC6372'>went through some more mummery, and then made grave announcement:</div><div class='line' id='LC6373'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6374'>&quot;The high and mighty Emperor of the East doth at this moment put</div><div class='line' id='LC6375'>money in the palm of a holy begging friar--one, two, three pieces,</div><div class='line' id='LC6376'>and they be all of silver.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6377'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6378'>A buzz of admiring exclamations broke out, all around:</div><div class='line' id='LC6379'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6380'>&quot;It is marvelous!&quot;  &quot;Wonderful!&quot;  &quot;What study, what labor, to have</div><div class='line' id='LC6381'>acquired a so amazing power as this!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6382'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6383'>Would they like to know what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing?</div><div class='line' id='LC6384'>Yes.  He told them what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing.  Then</div><div class='line' id='LC6385'>he told them what the Sultan of Egypt was at; also what the King</div><div class='line' id='LC6386'>of the Remote Seas was about.  And so on and so on; and with each</div><div class='line' id='LC6387'>new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher.</div><div class='line' id='LC6388'>They thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time;</div><div class='line' id='LC6389'>but no, he never had to hesitate, he always knew, and always with</div><div class='line' id='LC6390'>unerring precision.  I saw that if this thing went on I should lose</div><div class='line' id='LC6391'>my supremacy, this fellow would capture my following, I should</div><div class='line' id='LC6392'>be left out in the cold.  I must put a cog in his wheel, and do it</div><div class='line' id='LC6393'>right away, too.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC6394'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6395'>&quot;If I might ask, I should very greatly like to know what a certain</div><div class='line' id='LC6396'>person is doing.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6397'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6398'>&quot;Speak, and freely.  I will tell you.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6399'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6400'>&quot;It will be difficult--perhaps impossible.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6401'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6402'>&quot;My art knoweth not that word.  The more difficult it is, the more</div><div class='line' id='LC6403'>certainly will I reveal it to you.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6404'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6405'>You see, I was working up the interest.  It was getting pretty</div><div class='line' id='LC6406'>high, too; you could see that by the craning necks all around,</div><div class='line' id='LC6407'>and the half-suspended breathing.  So now I climaxed it:</div><div class='line' id='LC6408'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6409'>&quot;If you make no mistake--if you tell me truly what I want to</div><div class='line' id='LC6410'>know--I will give you two hundred silver pennies.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6411'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6412'>&quot;The fortune is mine!  I will tell you what you would know.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6413'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6414'>&quot;Then tell me what I am doing with my right hand.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6415'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6416'>&quot;Ah-h!&quot;  There was a general gasp of surprise.  It had not occurred</div><div class='line' id='LC6417'>to anybody in the crowd--that simple trick of inquiring about</div><div class='line' id='LC6418'>somebody who wasn&#39;t ten thousand miles away.  The magician was</div><div class='line' id='LC6419'>hit hard; it was an emergency that had never happened in his</div><div class='line' id='LC6420'>experience before, and it corked him; he didn&#39;t know how to meet</div><div class='line' id='LC6421'>it.  He looked stunned, confused; he couldn&#39;t say a word.  &quot;Come,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6422'>I said, &quot;what are you waiting for?  Is it possible you can answer up,</div><div class='line' id='LC6423'>right off, and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is</div><div class='line' id='LC6424'>doing, and yet can&#39;t tell what a person is doing who isn&#39;t three</div><div class='line' id='LC6425'>yards from you?  Persons behind me know what I am doing with my</div><div class='line' id='LC6426'>right hand--they will indorse you if you tell correctly.&quot;  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC6427'>still dumb.  &quot;Very well, I&#39;ll tell you why you don&#39;t speak up and</div><div class='line' id='LC6428'>tell; it is because you don&#39;t know.  _You_ a magician!  Good friends,</div><div class='line' id='LC6429'>this tramp is a mere fraud and liar.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6430'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6431'>This distressed the monks and terrified them.  They were not used</div><div class='line' id='LC6432'>to hearing these awful beings called names, and they did not know</div><div class='line' id='LC6433'>what might be the consequence.  There was a dead silence now;</div><div class='line' id='LC6434'>superstitious bodings were in every mind.  The magician began to</div><div class='line' id='LC6435'>pull his wits together, and when he presently smiled an easy,</div><div class='line' id='LC6436'>nonchalant smile, it spread a mighty relief around; for it indicated</div><div class='line' id='LC6437'>that his mood was not destructive.  He said:</div><div class='line' id='LC6438'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6439'>&quot;It hath struck me speechless, the frivolity of this person&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC6440'>speech.  Let all know, if perchance there be any who know it not,</div><div class='line' id='LC6441'>that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with</div><div class='line' id='LC6442'>the doings of any but kings, princes, emperors, them that be born</div><div class='line' id='LC6443'>in the purple and them only.  Had ye asked me what Arthur the great</div><div class='line' id='LC6444'>king is doing, it were another matter, and I had told ye; but the</div><div class='line' id='LC6445'>doings of a subject interest me not.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6446'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6447'>&quot;Oh, I misunderstood you.  I thought you said &#39;anybody,&#39; and so</div><div class='line' id='LC6448'>I supposed &#39;anybody&#39; included--well, anybody; that is, everybody.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6449'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6450'>&quot;It doth--anybody that is of lofty birth; and the better if</div><div class='line' id='LC6451'>he be royal.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6452'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6453'>&quot;That, it meseemeth, might well be,&quot; said the abbot, who saw his</div><div class='line' id='LC6454'>opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster, &quot;for it were not</div><div class='line' id='LC6455'>likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for</div><div class='line' id='LC6456'>the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be</div><div class='line' id='LC6457'>born near to the summits of greatness.  Our Arthur the king--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6458'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6459'>&quot;Would you know of him?&quot; broke in the enchanter.</div><div class='line' id='LC6460'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6461'>&quot;Most gladly, yea, and gratefully.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6462'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6463'>Everybody was full of awe and interest again right away, the</div><div class='line' id='LC6464'>incorrigible idiots.  They watched the incantations absorbingly,</div><div class='line' id='LC6465'>and looked at me with a &quot;There, now, what can you say to that?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6466'>air, when the announcement came:</div><div class='line' id='LC6467'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6468'>&quot;The king is weary with the chase, and lieth in his palace these</div><div class='line' id='LC6469'>two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6470'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6471'>&quot;God&#39;s benison upon him!&quot; said the abbot, and crossed himself;</div><div class='line' id='LC6472'>&quot;may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6473'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6474'>&quot;And so it might be, if he were sleeping,&quot; I said, &quot;but the king</div><div class='line' id='LC6475'>is not sleeping, the king rides.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6476'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6477'>Here was trouble again--a conflict of authority.  Nobody knew which</div><div class='line' id='LC6478'>of us to believe; I still had some reputation left.  The magician&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC6479'>scorn was stirred, and he said:</div><div class='line' id='LC6480'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6481'>&quot;Lo, I have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and</div><div class='line' id='LC6482'>magicians in my life days, but none before that could sit idle and</div><div class='line' id='LC6483'>see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6484'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6485'>&quot;You have lived in the woods, and lost much by it.  I use incantations</div><div class='line' id='LC6486'>myself, as this good brotherhood are aware--but only on occasions</div><div class='line' id='LC6487'>of moment.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6488'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6489'>When it comes to sarcasming, I reckon I know how to keep my end up.</div><div class='line' id='LC6490'>That jab made this fellow squirm.  The abbot inquired after the</div><div class='line' id='LC6491'>queen and the court, and got this information:</div><div class='line' id='LC6492'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6493'>&quot;They be all on sleep, being overcome by fatigue, like as to the king.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6494'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6495'>I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC6496'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6497'>&quot;That is merely another lie.  Half of them are about their amusements,</div><div class='line' id='LC6498'>the queen and the other half are not sleeping, they ride.  Now</div><div class='line' id='LC6499'>perhaps you can spread yourself a little, and tell us where the king</div><div class='line' id='LC6500'>and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6501'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6502'>&quot;They sleep now, as I said; but on the morrow they will ride,</div><div class='line' id='LC6503'>for they go a journey toward the sea.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6504'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6505'>&quot;And where will they be the day after to-morrow at vespers?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6506'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6507'>&quot;Far to the north of Camelot, and half their journey will be done.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6508'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6509'>&quot;That is another lie, by the space of a hundred and fifty miles.</div><div class='line' id='LC6510'>Their journey will not be merely half done, it will be all done,</div><div class='line' id='LC6511'>and they will be _here_, in this valley.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6512'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6513'>_That_ was a noble shot!  It set the abbot and the monks in a whirl</div><div class='line' id='LC6514'>of excitement, and it rocked the enchanter to his base.  I followed</div><div class='line' id='LC6515'>the thing right up:</div><div class='line' id='LC6516'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6517'>&quot;If the king does not arrive, I will have myself ridden on a rail:</div><div class='line' id='LC6518'>if he does I will ride you on a rail instead.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6519'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6520'>Next day I went up to the telephone office and found that the king</div><div class='line' id='LC6521'>had passed through two towns that were on the line.  I spotted</div><div class='line' id='LC6522'>his progress on the succeeding day in the same way.  I kept these</div><div class='line' id='LC6523'>matters to myself.  The third day&#39;s reports showed that if he</div><div class='line' id='LC6524'>kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon.  There</div><div class='line' id='LC6525'>was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming; there seemed</div><div class='line' id='LC6526'>to be no preparations making to receive him in state; a strange</div><div class='line' id='LC6527'>thing, truly.  Only one thing could explain this: that other</div><div class='line' id='LC6528'>magician had been cutting under me, sure.  This was true.  I asked</div><div class='line' id='LC6529'>a friend of mine, a monk, about it, and he said, yes, the magician</div><div class='line' id='LC6530'>had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court</div><div class='line' id='LC6531'>had concluded to make no journey at all, but stay at home.  Think</div><div class='line' id='LC6532'>of that!  Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country.</div><div class='line' id='LC6533'>These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in</div><div class='line' id='LC6534'>history, and the only one within their memory that had a positive</div><div class='line' id='LC6535'>value, and yet here they were, ready to take up with an adventurer</div><div class='line' id='LC6536'>who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word.</div><div class='line' id='LC6537'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6538'>However, it was not good politics to let the king come without</div><div class='line' id='LC6539'>any fuss and feathers at all, so I went down and drummed up a</div><div class='line' id='LC6540'>procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and</div><div class='line' id='LC6541'>started them out at two o&#39;clock to meet him.  And that was the</div><div class='line' id='LC6542'>sort of state he arrived in.  The abbot was helpless with rage</div><div class='line' id='LC6543'>and humiliation when I brought him out on a balcony and showed</div><div class='line' id='LC6544'>him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to</div><div class='line' id='LC6545'>offer him welcome, and no stir of life or clang of joy-bell to glad</div><div class='line' id='LC6546'>his spirit.  He took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces.</div><div class='line' id='LC6547'>The next minute the bells were dinning furiously, and the various</div><div class='line' id='LC6548'>buildings were vomiting monks and nuns, who went swarming in a</div><div class='line' id='LC6549'>rush toward the coming procession; and with them went that magician</div><div class='line' id='LC6550'>--and he was on a rail, too, by the abbot&#39;s order; and his reputation</div><div class='line' id='LC6551'>was in the mud, and mine was in the sky again.  Yes, a man can</div><div class='line' id='LC6552'>keep his trademark current in such a country, but he can&#39;t sit</div><div class='line' id='LC6553'>around and do it; he has got to be on deck and attending to business</div><div class='line' id='LC6554'>right along.</div><div class='line' id='LC6555'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6556'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6557'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6558'>CHAPTER XXV</div><div class='line' id='LC6559'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6560'>A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION</div><div class='line' id='LC6561'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6562'>When the king traveled for change of air, or made a progress, or</div><div class='line' id='LC6563'>visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost</div><div class='line' id='LC6564'>of his keep, part of the administration moved with him.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC6565'>a fashion of the time.  The Commission charged with the examination</div><div class='line' id='LC6566'>of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the</div><div class='line' id='LC6567'>Valley, whereas they could have transacted their business just</div><div class='line' id='LC6568'>as well at home.  And although this expedition was strictly a</div><div class='line' id='LC6569'>holiday excursion for the king, he kept some of his business</div><div class='line' id='LC6570'>functions going just the same.  He touched for the evil, as usual;</div><div class='line' id='LC6571'>he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases, for he was</div><div class='line' id='LC6572'>himself Chief Justice of the King&#39;s Bench.</div><div class='line' id='LC6573'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6574'>He shone very well in this latter office.  He was a wise and humane</div><div class='line' id='LC6575'>judge, and he clearly did his honest best and fairest,--according</div><div class='line' id='LC6576'>to his lights.  That is a large reservation.  His lights--I mean</div><div class='line' id='LC6577'>his rearing--often colored his decisions.  Whenever there was a</div><div class='line' id='LC6578'>dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree,</div><div class='line' id='LC6579'>the king&#39;s leanings and sympathies were for the former class always,</div><div class='line' id='LC6580'>whether he suspected it or not.  It was impossible that this should</div><div class='line' id='LC6581'>be otherwise.  The blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholder&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC6582'>moral perceptions are known and conceded, the world over; and a</div><div class='line' id='LC6583'>privileged class, an aristocracy, is but a band of slaveholders</div><div class='line' id='LC6584'>under another name.  This has a harsh sound, and yet should not</div><div class='line' id='LC6585'>be offensive to any--even to the noble himself--unless the fact</div><div class='line' id='LC6586'>itself be an offense: for the statement simply formulates a fact.</div><div class='line' id='LC6587'>The repulsive feature of slavery is the _thing_, not its name.  One</div><div class='line' id='LC6588'>needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below</div><div class='line' id='LC6589'>him to recognize--and in but indifferently modified measure</div><div class='line' id='LC6590'>--the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder; and behind these</div><div class='line' id='LC6591'>are the slaveholder&#39;s spirit, the slaveholder&#39;s blunted feeling.</div><div class='line' id='LC6592'>They are the result of the same cause in both cases: the possessor&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC6593'>old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being.</div><div class='line' id='LC6594'>The king&#39;s judgments wrought frequent injustices, but it was merely</div><div class='line' id='LC6595'>the fault of his training, his natural and unalterable sympathies.</div><div class='line' id='LC6596'>He was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother</div><div class='line' id='LC6597'>for the position of milk-distributor to starving children in</div><div class='line' id='LC6598'>famine-time; her own children would fare a shade better than the rest.</div><div class='line' id='LC6599'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6600'>One very curious case came before the king.  A young girl, an</div><div class='line' id='LC6601'>orphan, who had a considerable estate, married a fine young fellow</div><div class='line' id='LC6602'>who had nothing.  The girl&#39;s property was within a seigniory held</div><div class='line' id='LC6603'>by the Church.  The bishop of the diocese, an arrogant scion of</div><div class='line' id='LC6604'>the great nobility, claimed the girl&#39;s estate on the ground that</div><div class='line' id='LC6605'>she had married privately, and thus had cheated the Church out</div><div class='line' id='LC6606'>of one of its rights as lord of the seigniory--the one heretofore</div><div class='line' id='LC6607'>referred to as le droit du seigneur.  The penalty of refusal or</div><div class='line' id='LC6608'>avoidance was confiscation.  The girl&#39;s defense was, that the</div><div class='line' id='LC6609'>lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop, and the</div><div class='line' id='LC6610'>particular right here involved was not transferable, but must be</div><div class='line' id='LC6611'>exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated; and that an older</div><div class='line' id='LC6612'>law, of the Church itself, strictly barred the bishop from exercising</div><div class='line' id='LC6613'>it.  It was a very odd case, indeed.</div><div class='line' id='LC6614'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6615'>It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the</div><div class='line' id='LC6616'>ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money</div><div class='line' id='LC6617'>that built the Mansion House.  A person who had not taken the</div><div class='line' id='LC6618'>Sacrament according to the Anglican rite could not stand as a</div><div class='line' id='LC6619'>candidate for sheriff of London.  Thus Dissenters were ineligible;</div><div class='line' id='LC6620'>they could not run if asked, they could not serve if elected.</div><div class='line' id='LC6621'>The aldermen, who without any question were Yankees in disguise,</div><div class='line' id='LC6622'>hit upon this neat device: they passed a by-law imposing a fine</div><div class='line' id='LC6623'>of L400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for</div><div class='line' id='LC6624'>sheriff, and a fine of L600 upon any person who, after being</div><div class='line' id='LC6625'>elected sheriff, refused to serve.  Then they went to work and</div><div class='line' id='LC6626'>elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, and kept it up</div><div class='line' id='LC6627'>until they had collected L15,000 in fines; and there stands the</div><div class='line' id='LC6628'>stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing citizen</div><div class='line' id='LC6629'>in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees</div><div class='line' id='LC6630'>slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given</div><div class='line' id='LC6631'>their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good</div><div class='line' id='LC6632'>and holy peoples that be in the earth.</div><div class='line' id='LC6633'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6634'>The girl&#39;s case seemed strong to me; the bishop&#39;s case was just</div><div class='line' id='LC6635'>as strong.  I did not see how the king was going to get out of</div><div class='line' id='LC6636'>this hole.  But he got out.  I append his decision:</div><div class='line' id='LC6637'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6638'>&quot;Truly I find small difficulty here, the matter being even a</div><div class='line' id='LC6639'>child&#39;s affair for simpleness.  An the young bride had conveyed</div><div class='line' id='LC6640'>notice, as in duty bound, to her feudal lord and proper master</div><div class='line' id='LC6641'>and protector the bishop, she had suffered no loss, for the said</div><div class='line' id='LC6642'>bishop could have got a dispensation making him, for temporary</div><div class='line' id='LC6643'>conveniency, eligible to the exercise of his said right, and thus</div><div class='line' id='LC6644'>would she have kept all she had.  Whereas, failing in her first</div><div class='line' id='LC6645'>duty, she hath by that failure failed in all; for whoso, clinging</div><div class='line' id='LC6646'>to a rope, severeth it above his hands, must fall; it being no</div><div class='line' id='LC6647'>defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound, neither any</div><div class='line' id='LC6648'>deliverance from his peril, as he shall find.  Pardy, the woman&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC6649'>case is rotten at the source.  It is the decree of the court that</div><div class='line' id='LC6650'>she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods, even to the</div><div class='line' id='LC6651'>last farthing that she doth possess, and be thereto mulcted in</div><div class='line' id='LC6652'>the costs.  Next!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6653'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6654'>Here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months</div><div class='line' id='LC6655'>old.  Poor young creatures!  They had lived these three months</div><div class='line' id='LC6656'>lapped to the lips in worldly comforts.  These clothes and trinkets</div><div class='line' id='LC6657'>they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch</div><div class='line' id='LC6658'>of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree; and in</div><div class='line' id='LC6659'>these pretty clothes, she crying on his shoulder, and he trying</div><div class='line' id='LC6660'>to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair,</div><div class='line' id='LC6661'>they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless,</div><div class='line' id='LC6662'>bedless, breadless; why, the very beggars by the roadsides were</div><div class='line' id='LC6663'>not so poor as they.</div><div class='line' id='LC6664'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6665'>Well, the king was out of the hole; and on terms satisfactory to</div><div class='line' id='LC6666'>the Church and the rest of the aristocracy, no doubt.  Men write</div><div class='line' id='LC6667'>many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy, but</div><div class='line' id='LC6668'>the fact remains that where every man in a State has a vote, brutal</div><div class='line' id='LC6669'>laws are impossible.  Arthur&#39;s people were of course poor material</div><div class='line' id='LC6670'>for a republic, because they had been debased so long by monarchy;</div><div class='line' id='LC6671'>and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short</div><div class='line' id='LC6672'>work of that law which the king had just been administering if it</div><div class='line' id='LC6673'>had been submitted to their full and free vote.  There is a phrase</div><div class='line' id='LC6674'>which has grown so common in the world&#39;s mouth that it has come</div><div class='line' id='LC6675'>to seem to have sense and meaning--the sense and meaning implied</div><div class='line' id='LC6676'>when it is used; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or</div><div class='line' id='LC6677'>the other nation as possibly being &quot;capable of self-government&quot;;</div><div class='line' id='LC6678'>and the implied sense of it is, that there has been a nation</div><div class='line' id='LC6679'>somewhere, some time or other which _wasn&#39;t_ capable of it--wasn&#39;t as</div><div class='line' id='LC6680'>able to govern itself as some self-appointed specialists were or</div><div class='line' id='LC6681'>would be to govern it.  The master minds of all nations, in all</div><div class='line' id='LC6682'>ages, have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation,</div><div class='line' id='LC6683'>and from the mass of the nation only--not from its privileged</div><div class='line' id='LC6684'>classes; and so, no matter what the nation&#39;s intellectual grade</div><div class='line' id='LC6685'>was; whether high or low, the bulk of its ability was in the long</div><div class='line' id='LC6686'>ranks of its nameless and its poor, and so it never saw the day</div><div class='line' id='LC6687'>that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself.</div><div class='line' id='LC6688'>Which is to assert an always self-proven fact: that even the best</div><div class='line' id='LC6689'>governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still</div><div class='line' id='LC6690'>behind the best condition attainable by its people; and that the</div><div class='line' id='LC6691'>same is true of kindred governments of lower grades, all the way</div><div class='line' id='LC6692'>down to the lowest.</div><div class='line' id='LC6693'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6694'>King Arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond</div><div class='line' id='LC6695'>my calculations.  I had not supposed he would move in the matter</div><div class='line' id='LC6696'>while I was away; and so I had not mapped out a scheme for determining</div><div class='line' id='LC6697'>the merits of officers; I had only remarked that it would be wise</div><div class='line' id='LC6698'>to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination;</div><div class='line' id='LC6699'>and privately I meant to put together a list of military qualifications</div><div class='line' id='LC6700'>that nobody could answer to but my West Pointers.  That ought</div><div class='line' id='LC6701'>to have been attended to before I left; for the king was so taken</div><div class='line' id='LC6702'>with the idea of a standing army that he couldn&#39;t wait but must</div><div class='line' id='LC6703'>get about it at once, and get up as good a scheme of examination</div><div class='line' id='LC6704'>as he could invent out of his own head.</div><div class='line' id='LC6705'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6706'>I was impatient to see what this was; and to show, too, how much</div><div class='line' id='LC6707'>more admirable was the one which I should display to the Examining</div><div class='line' id='LC6708'>Board.  I intimated this, gently, to the king, and it fired his</div><div class='line' id='LC6709'>curiosity.  When the Board was assembled, I followed him in; and</div><div class='line' id='LC6710'>behind us came the candidates.  One of these candidates was a bright</div><div class='line' id='LC6711'>young West Pointer of mine, and with him were a couple of my</div><div class='line' id='LC6712'>West Point professors.</div><div class='line' id='LC6713'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6714'>When I saw the Board, I did not know whether to cry or to laugh.</div><div class='line' id='LC6715'>The head of it was the officer known to later centuries as Norroy</div><div class='line' id='LC6716'>King-at-Arms!

Get you hence.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC6743'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC6744'>But I appealed to the king.

I had had a blackboard</div><div class='line' id='LC6750'>prepared, and it was put up now, and the circus began.

It would also be a good</div><div class='line' id='LC6980'>idea to add five hundred officers to it; in fact, add as many</div><div class='line' id='LC6981'>officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the</div><div class='line' id='LC6982'>country, even if there should finally be five times as many officers</div><div class='line' id='LC6983'>as privates in it; and thus make it the crack regiment, the envied</div><div class='line' id='LC6984'>regiment, the King&#39;s Own regiment, and entitled to fight on its</div><div class='line' id='LC6985'>own hook and in its own way, and go whither it would and come</div><div class='line' id='LC6986'>when it pleased, in time of war, and be utterly swell and independent.</div><div class='line' id='LC6987'>This would make that regiment the heart&#39;s desire of all the</div><div class='line' id='LC6988'>nobility, and they would all be satisfied and happy.  Then we</div><div class='line' id='LC6989'>would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace</div><div class='line' id='LC6990'>materials, and officer it with nobodies, as was proper--nobodies</div><div class='line' id='LC6991'>selected on a basis of mere efficiency--and we would make this</div><div class='line' id='LC6992'>regiment toe the line, allow it no aristocratic freedom from</div><div class='line' id='LC6993'>restraint, and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering,</div><div class='line' id='LC6994'>to the end that whenever the King&#39;s Own was tired and wanted to go</div><div class='line' id='LC6995'>off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good</div><div class='line' id='LC6996'>time, it could go without uneasiness, knowing that matters were in</div><div class='line' id='LC6997'>safe hands behind it, and business going to be continued at the</div><div class='line' id='LC6998'>old stand, same as usual.  The king was charmed with the idea.</div><div class='line' id='LC6999'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7000'>When I noticed that, it gave me a valuable notion.  I thought</div><div class='line' id='LC7001'>I saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last.  You</div><div class='line' id='LC7002'>see, the royalties of the Pendragon stock were a long-lived race</div><div class='line' id='LC7003'>and very fruitful.  Whenever a child was born to any of these</div><div class='line' id='LC7004'>--and it was pretty often--there was wild joy in the nation&#39;s mouth,</div><div class='line' id='LC7005'>and piteous sorrow in the nation&#39;s heart.  The joy was questionable,</div><div class='line' id='LC7006'>but the grief was honest.  Because the event meant another call</div><div class='line' id='LC7007'>for a Royal Grant.  Long was the list of these royalties, and</div><div class='line' id='LC7008'>they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury</div><div class='line' id='LC7009'>and a menace to the crown.  Yet Arthur could not believe this</div><div class='line' id='LC7010'>latter fact, and he would not listen to any of my various projects</div><div class='line' id='LC7011'>for substituting something in the place of the royal grants.  If I</div><div class='line' id='LC7012'>could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for</div><div class='line' id='LC7013'>one of these outlying scions from his own pocket, I could have</div><div class='line' id='LC7014'>made a grand to-do over it, and it would have had a good effect</div><div class='line' id='LC7015'>with the nation; but no, he wouldn&#39;t hear of such a thing.  He had</div><div class='line' id='LC7016'>something like a religious passion for royal grant; he seemed to</div><div class='line' id='LC7017'>look upon it as a sort of sacred swag, and one could not irritate</div><div class='line' id='LC7018'>him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that</div><div class='line' id='LC7019'>venerable institution.  If I ventured to cautiously hint that there</div><div class='line' id='LC7020'>was not another respectable family in England that would humble</div><div class='line' id='LC7021'>itself to hold out the hat--however, that is as far as I ever got;</div><div class='line' id='LC7022'>he always cut me short there, and peremptorily, too.</div><div class='line' id='LC7023'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7024'>But I believed I saw my chance at last.  I would form this crack</div><div class='line' id='LC7025'>regiment out of officers alone--not a single private.  Half of it</div><div class='line' id='LC7026'>should consist of nobles, who should fill all the places up to</div><div class='line' id='LC7027'>Major-General, and serve gratis and pay their own expenses; and</div><div class='line' id='LC7028'>they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest</div><div class='line' id='LC7029'>of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood.</div><div class='line' id='LC7030'>These princes of the blood should range in rank from Lieutenant-General</div><div class='line' id='LC7031'>up to Field Marshal, and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and</div><div class='line' id='LC7032'>fed by the state.  Moreover--and this was the master stroke</div><div class='line' id='LC7033'>--it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always</div><div class='line' id='LC7034'>addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe-compelling title (which</div><div class='line' id='LC7035'>I would presently invent), and they and they only in all England</div><div class='line' id='LC7036'>should be so addressed.  Finally, all princes of the blood should</div><div class='line' id='LC7037'>have free choice; join that regiment, get that great title, and</div><div class='line' id='LC7038'>renounce the royal grant, or stay out and receive a grant.  Neatest</div><div class='line' id='LC7039'>touch of all: unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be</div><div class='line' id='LC7040'>_born_ into the regiment, and start fair, with good wages and a</div><div class='line' id='LC7041'>permanent situation, upon due notice from the parents.</div><div class='line' id='LC7042'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7043'>All the boys would join, I was sure of that; so, all existing</div><div class='line' id='LC7044'>grants would be relinquished; that the newly born would always</div><div class='line' id='LC7045'>join was equally certain.  Within sixty days that quaint and</div><div class='line' id='LC7046'>bizarre anomaly, the Royal Grant, would cease to be a living fact,</div><div class='line' id='LC7047'>and take its place among the curiosities of the past.</div><div class='line' id='LC7048'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7049'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7050'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7051'>CHAPTER XXVI</div><div class='line' id='LC7052'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7053'>THE FIRST NEWSPAPER</div><div class='line' id='LC7054'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7055'>When I told the king I was going out disguised as a petty freeman</div><div class='line' id='LC7056'>to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life</div><div class='line' id='LC7057'>of the people, he was all afire with the novelty of the thing</div><div class='line' id='LC7058'>in a minute, and was bound to take a chance in the adventure</div><div class='line' id='LC7059'>himself--nothing should stop him--he would drop everything and</div><div class='line' id='LC7060'>go along--it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many</div><div class='line' id='LC7061'>a day.  He wanted to glide out the back way and start at once;</div><div class='line' id='LC7062'>but I showed him that that wouldn&#39;t answer.

And I thought</div><div class='line' id='LC7066'>he ought to tell the queen he was going away.  He clouded up at</div><div class='line' id='LC7067'>that and looked sad.

Many&#39;s the time she had asked me, &quot;Sir Boss, hast seen</div><div class='line' id='LC7078'>Sir Launcelot about?&quot; but if ever she went fretting around for</div><div class='line' id='LC7079'>the king I didn&#39;t happen to be around at the time.</div><div class='line' id='LC7080'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7081'>There was a very good lay-out for the king&#39;s-evil business--very</div><div class='line' id='LC7082'>tidy and creditable.  The king sat under a canopy of state; about</div><div class='line' id='LC7083'>him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals.</div><div class='line' id='LC7084'>Conspicuous, both for location and personal outfit, stood Marinel,</div><div class='line' id='LC7085'>a hermit of the quack-doctor species, to introduce the sick.  All</div><div class='line' id='LC7086'>abroad over the spacious floor, and clear down to the doors,</div><div class='line' id='LC7087'>in a thick jumble, lay or sat the scrofulous, under a strong light.</div><div class='line' id='LC7088'>It was as good as a tableau; in fact, it had all the look of being</div><div class='line' id='LC7089'>gotten up for that, though it wasn&#39;t.  There were eight hundred</div><div class='line' id='LC7090'>sick people present.  The work was slow; it lacked the interest</div><div class='line' id='LC7091'>of novelty for me, because I had seen the ceremonies before;</div><div class='line' id='LC7092'>the thing soon became tedious, but the proprieties required me</div><div class='line' id='LC7093'>to stick it out.  The doctor was there for the reason that in all</div><div class='line' id='LC7094'>such crowds there were many people who only imagined something</div><div class='line' id='LC7095'>was the matter with them, and many who were consciously sound</div><div class='line' id='LC7096'>but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king, and</div><div class='line' id='LC7097'>yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of</div><div class='line' id='LC7098'>coin that went with the touch.  Up to this time this coin had been</div><div class='line' id='LC7099'>a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar.  When you</div><div class='line' id='LC7100'>consider how much that amount of money would buy, in that age</div><div class='line' id='LC7101'>and country, and how usual it was to be scrofulous, when not dead,</div><div class='line' id='LC7102'>you would understand that the annual king&#39;s-evil appropriation was</div><div class='line' id='LC7103'>just the River and Harbor bill of that government for the grip it</div><div class='line' id='LC7104'>took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the</div><div class='line' id='LC7105'>surplus.  So I had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself</div><div class='line' id='LC7106'>for the king&#39;s-evil.  I covered six-sevenths of the appropriation</div><div class='line' id='LC7107'>into the treasury a week before starting from Camelot on my</div><div class='line' id='LC7108'>adventures, and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into</div><div class='line' id='LC7109'>five-cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk</div><div class='line' id='LC7110'>of the King&#39;s Evil Department; a nickel to take the place of each</div><div class='line' id='LC7111'>gold coin, you see, and do its work for it.  It might strain the</div><div class='line' id='LC7112'>nickel some, but I judged it could stand it.  As a rule, I do not</div><div class='line' id='LC7113'>approve of watering stock, but I considered it square enough</div><div class='line' id='LC7114'>in this case, for it was just a gift, anyway.  Of course, you can</div><div class='line' id='LC7115'>water a gift as much as you want to; and I generally do.  The old</div><div class='line' id='LC7116'>gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown</div><div class='line' id='LC7117'>origin, as a rule, but some of them were Roman; they were ill-shapen,</div><div class='line' id='LC7118'>and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full; they</div><div class='line' id='LC7119'>were hammered, not minted, and they were so worn with use that</div><div class='line' id='LC7120'>the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters, and looked</div><div class='line' id='LC7121'>like them.  I judged that a sharp, bright new nickel, with a</div><div class='line' id='LC7122'>first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and Guenever</div><div class='line' id='LC7123'>on the other, and a blooming pious motto, would take the tuck out</div><div class='line' id='LC7124'>of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous</div><div class='line' id='LC7125'>fancy more; and I was right.  This batch was the first it was</div><div class='line' id='LC7126'>tried on, and it worked to a charm.  The saving in expense was</div><div class='line' id='LC7127'>a notable economy.  You will see that by these figures: We touched</div><div class='line' id='LC7128'>a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former rates, this would</div><div class='line' id='LC7129'>have cost the government about $240; at the new rate we pulled</div><div class='line' id='LC7130'>through for about $35, thus saving upward of $200 at one swoop.</div><div class='line' id='LC7131'>To appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke, consider these</div><div class='line' id='LC7132'>other figures: the annual expenses of a national government amount</div><div class='line' id='LC7133'>to the equivalent of a contribution of three days&#39; average wages of</div><div class='line' id='LC7134'>every individual of the population, counting every individual as</div><div class='line' id='LC7135'>if he were a man.  If you take a nation of 60,000,000, where average</div><div class='line' id='LC7136'>wages are $2 per day, three days&#39; wages taken from each individual</div><div class='line' id='LC7137'>will provide $360,000,000 and pay the government&#39;s expenses.  In my</div><div class='line' id='LC7138'>day, in my own country, this money was collected from imposts,</div><div class='line' id='LC7139'>and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it, and it</div><div class='line' id='LC7140'>made him comfortable to think so; whereas, in fact, it was paid</div><div class='line' id='LC7141'>by the American people, and was so equally and exactly distributed</div><div class='line' id='LC7142'>among them that the annual cost to the 100-millionaire and the</div><div class='line' id='LC7143'>annual cost to the sucking child of the day-laborer was precisely</div><div class='line' id='LC7144'>the same--each paid $6.  Nothing could be equaler than that,</div><div class='line' id='LC7145'>I reckon.  Well, Scotland and Ireland were tributary to Arthur,</div><div class='line' id='LC7146'>and the united populations of the British Islands amounted to</div><div class='line' id='LC7147'>something less than 1,000,000.  A mechanic&#39;s average wage was</div><div class='line' id='LC7148'>3 cents a day, when he paid his own keep.  By this rule the national</div><div class='line' id='LC7149'>government&#39;s expenses were $90,000 a year, or about $250 a day.</div><div class='line' id='LC7150'>Thus, by the substitution of nickels for gold on a king&#39;s-evil</div><div class='line' id='LC7151'>day, I not only injured no one, dissatisfied no one, but pleased</div><div class='line' id='LC7152'>all concerned and saved four-fifths of that day&#39;s national expense</div><div class='line' id='LC7153'>into the bargain--a saving which would have been the equivalent</div><div class='line' id='LC7154'>of $800,000 in my day in America.  In making this substitution</div><div class='line' id='LC7155'>I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source--the wisdom</div><div class='line' id='LC7156'>of my boyhood--for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom,</div><div class='line' id='LC7157'>howsoever lowly may be its origin: in my boyhood I had always</div><div class='line' id='LC7158'>saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary</div><div class='line' id='LC7159'>cause.  The buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as</div><div class='line' id='LC7160'>the coin, the coin would answer me better than the buttons; all</div><div class='line' id='LC7161'>hands were happy and nobody hurt.</div><div class='line' id='LC7162'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7163'>Marinel took the patients as they came.  He examined the candidate;</div><div class='line' id='LC7164'>if he couldn&#39;t qualify he was warned off; if he could he was passed</div><div class='line' id='LC7165'>along to the king.  A priest pronounced the words, &quot;They shall</div><div class='line' id='LC7166'>lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&quot;  Then the king</div><div class='line' id='LC7167'>stroked the ulcers, while the reading continued; finally, the</div><div class='line' id='LC7168'>patient graduated and got his nickel--the king hanging it around</div><div class='line' id='LC7169'>his neck himself--and was dismissed.  Would you think that that</div><div class='line' id='LC7170'>would cure?  It certainly did.  Any mummery will cure if the</div><div class='line' id='LC7171'>patient&#39;s faith is strong in it.  Up by Astolat there was a chapel</div><div class='line' id='LC7172'>where the Virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd</div><div class='line' id='LC7173'>geese around there--the girl said so herself--and they built the</div><div class='line' id='LC7174'>chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the</div><div class='line' id='LC7175'>occurrence--a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick</div><div class='line' id='LC7176'>person to approach; whereas, on the contrary, thousands of the lame</div><div class='line' id='LC7177'>and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away</div><div class='line' id='LC7178'>whole and sound; and even the well could look upon it and live.</div><div class='line' id='LC7179'>Of course, when I was told these things I did not believe them;</div><div class='line' id='LC7180'>but when I went there and saw them I had to succumb.  I saw the</div><div class='line' id='LC7181'>cures effected myself; and they were real cures and not questionable.</div><div class='line' id='LC7182'>I saw cripples whom I had seen around Camelot for years on crutches,</div><div class='line' id='LC7183'>arrive and pray before that picture, and put down their crutches</div><div class='line' id='LC7184'>and walk off without a limp.  There were piles of crutches there</div><div class='line' id='LC7185'>which had been left by such people as a testimony.</div><div class='line' id='LC7186'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7187'>In other places people operated on a patient&#39;s mind, without saying</div><div class='line' id='LC7188'>a word to him, and cured him.  In others, experts assembled patients</div><div class='line' id='LC7189'>in a room and prayed over them, and appealed to their faith, and</div><div class='line' id='LC7190'>those patients went away cured.  Wherever you find a king who can&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC7191'>cure the king&#39;s-evil you can be sure that the most valuable</div><div class='line' id='LC7192'>superstition that supports his throne--the subject&#39;s belief in</div><div class='line' id='LC7193'>the divine appointment of his sovereign--has passed away.  In my</div><div class='line' id='LC7194'>youth the monarchs of England had ceased to touch for the evil,</div><div class='line' id='LC7195'>but there was no occasion for this diffidence: they could have</div><div class='line' id='LC7196'>cured it forty-nine times in fifty.</div><div class='line' id='LC7197'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7198'>Well, when the priest had been droning for three hours, and the</div><div class='line' id='LC7199'>good king polishing the evidences, and the sick were still pressing</div><div class='line' id='LC7200'>forward as plenty as ever, I got to feeling intolerably bored.</div><div class='line' id='LC7201'>I was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state.</div><div class='line' id='LC7202'>For the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his</div><div class='line' id='LC7203'>repulsivenesses stroked; again those words were being droned out:</div><div class='line' id='LC7204'>&quot;they shall lay their hands on the sick&quot;--when outside there rang</div><div class='line' id='LC7205'>clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled</div><div class='line' id='LC7206'>thirteen worthless centuries about my ears: &quot;Camelot _Weekly</div><div class='line' id='LC7207'>Hosannah and Literary Volcano!_--latest irruption--only two cents</div><div class='line' id='LC7208'>--all about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness!&quot;  One greater</div><div class='line' id='LC7209'>than kings had arrived--the newsboy.

Yes.  So they took it, handling</div><div class='line' id='LC7409'>it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing</div><div class='line' id='LC7410'>come from some supernatural region; and gently felt of its texture,</div><div class='line' id='LC7411'>caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch, and</div><div class='line' id='LC7412'>scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes.  These</div><div class='line' id='LC7413'>grouped bent heads, these charmed faces, these speaking eyes</div><div class='line' id='LC7414'>--how beautiful to me!

I knew how she feels, and that there is</div><div class='line' id='LC7422'>no other satisfied ambition, whether of king, conqueror, or poet,</div><div class='line' id='LC7423'>that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half</div><div class='line' id='LC7424'>so divine a contentment.</div><div class='line' id='LC7425'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7426'>During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to</div><div class='line' id='LC7427'>group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye</div><div class='line' id='LC7428'>was upon it always, and I sat motionless, steeped in satisfaction,</div><div class='line' id='LC7429'>drunk with enjoyment.  Yes, this was heaven; I was tasting it once,</div><div class='line' id='LC7430'>if I might never taste it more.</div><div class='line' id='LC7431'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7432'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7433'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7434'>CHAPTER XXVII</div><div class='line' id='LC7435'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7436'>THE YANKEE AND THE KING TRAVEL INCOGNITO</div><div class='line' id='LC7437'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7438'>About bedtime I took the king to my private quarters to cut his</div><div class='line' id='LC7439'>hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear.</div><div class='line' id='LC7440'>The high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but</div><div class='line' id='LC7441'>hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around, whereas the</div><div class='line' id='LC7442'>lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both; the slaves</div><div class='line' id='LC7443'>were bangless, and allowed their hair free growth.  So I inverted</div><div class='line' id='LC7444'>a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it.</div><div class='line' id='LC7445'>I also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only</div><div class='line' id='LC7446'>about a half-inch long; and tried to do it inartistically, and</div><div class='line' id='LC7447'>succeeded.  It was a villainous disfigurement.  When he got his</div><div class='line' id='LC7448'>lubberly sandals on, and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth,</div><div class='line' id='LC7449'>which hung straight from his neck to his ankle-bones, he was no</div><div class='line' id='LC7450'>longer the comeliest man in his kingdom, but one of the unhandsomest</div><div class='line' id='LC7451'>and most commonplace and unattractive.  We were dressed and barbered</div><div class='line' id='LC7452'>alike, and could pass for small farmers, or farm bailiffs, or</div><div class='line' id='LC7453'>shepherds, or carters; yes, or for village artisans, if we chose,</div><div class='line' id='LC7454'>our costume being in effect universal among the poor, because of</div><div class='line' id='LC7455'>its strength and cheapness.  I don&#39;t mean that it was really cheap</div><div class='line' id='LC7456'>to a very poor person, but I do mean that it was the cheapest</div><div class='line' id='LC7457'>material there was for male attire--manufactured material, you</div><div class='line' id='LC7458'>understand.</div><div class='line' id='LC7459'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7460'>We slipped away an hour before dawn, and by broad sun-up had made</div><div class='line' id='LC7461'>eight or ten miles, and were in the midst of a sparsely settled</div><div class='line' id='LC7462'>country.  I had a pretty heavy knapsack; it was laden with</div><div class='line' id='LC7463'>provisions--provisions for the king to taper down on, till he</div><div class='line' id='LC7464'>could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage.</div><div class='line' id='LC7465'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7466'>I found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside, and then</div><div class='line' id='LC7467'>gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with.  Then I said</div><div class='line' id='LC7468'>I would find some water for him, and strolled away.  Part of my</div><div class='line' id='LC7469'>project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little</div><div class='line' id='LC7470'>myself.  It had always been my custom to stand when in his presence;</div><div class='line' id='LC7471'>even at the council board, except upon those rare occasions when</div><div class='line' id='LC7472'>the sitting was a very long one, extending over hours; then I had</div><div class='line' id='LC7473'>a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert</div><div class='line' id='LC7474'>and was as comfortable as the toothache.  I didn&#39;t want to break</div><div class='line' id='LC7475'>him in suddenly, but do it by degrees.  We should have to sit</div><div class='line' id='LC7476'>together now when in company, or people would notice; but it would</div><div class='line' id='LC7477'>not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when</div><div class='line' id='LC7478'>there was no necessity for it.</div><div class='line' id='LC7479'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7480'>I found the water some three hundred yards away, and had been</div><div class='line' id='LC7481'>resting about twenty minutes, when I heard voices.  That is all</div><div class='line' id='LC7482'>right, I thought--peasants going to work; nobody else likely to be</div><div class='line' id='LC7483'>stirring this early.  But the next moment these comers jingled into</div><div class='line' id='LC7484'>sight around a turn of the road--smartly clad people of quality,</div><div class='line' id='LC7485'>with luggage-mules and servants in their train!  I was off like</div><div class='line' id='LC7486'>a shot, through the bushes, by the shortest cut.  For a while it</div><div class='line' id='LC7487'>did seem that these people would pass the king before I could</div><div class='line' id='LC7488'>get to him; but desperation gives you wings, you know, and I canted</div><div class='line' id='LC7489'>my body forward, inflated my breast, and held my breath and flew.</div><div class='line' id='LC7490'>I arrived.  And in plenty good enough time, too.</div><div class='line' id='LC7491'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7492'>&quot;Pardon, my king, but it&#39;s no time for ceremony--jump!

He looked</div><div class='line' id='LC7510'>as humble as the leaning tower at Pisa.  It is the most you could</div><div class='line' id='LC7511'>say of it.  Indeed, it was such a thundering poor success that</div><div class='line' id='LC7512'>it raised wondering scowls all along the line, and a gorgeous</div><div class='line' id='LC7513'>flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip; but I jumped in</div><div class='line' id='LC7514'>time and was under it when it fell; and under cover of the volley</div><div class='line' id='LC7515'>of coarse laughter which followed, I spoke up sharply and warned</div><div class='line' id='LC7516'>the king to take no notice.  He mastered himself for the moment,</div><div class='line' id='LC7517'>but it was a sore tax; he wanted to eat up the procession.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC7518'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7519'>&quot;It would end our adventures at the very start; and we, being</div><div class='line' id='LC7520'>without weapons, could do nothing with that armed gang.  If we</div><div class='line' id='LC7521'>are going to succeed in our emprise, we must not only look the</div><div class='line' id='LC7522'>peasant but act the peasant.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7523'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7524'>&quot;It is wisdom; none can gainsay it.

He did the best he could, but I&#39;ve seen better.</div><div class='line' id='LC7528'>If you have ever seen an active, heedless, enterprising child</div><div class='line' id='LC7529'>going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day</div><div class='line' id='LC7530'>long, and an anxious mother at its heels all the while, and just</div><div class='line' id='LC7531'>saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with</div><div class='line' id='LC7532'>each new experiment, you&#39;ve seen the king and me.</div><div class='line' id='LC7533'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7534'>If I could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like,</div><div class='line' id='LC7535'>I should have said, No, if anybody wants to make his living</div><div class='line' id='LC7536'>exhibiting a king as a peasant, let him take the layout; I can</div><div class='line' id='LC7537'>do better with a menagerie, and last longer.  And yet, during</div><div class='line' id='LC7538'>the first three days I never allowed him to enter a hut or other</div><div class='line' id='LC7539'>dwelling.  If he could pass muster anywhere during his early</div><div class='line' id='LC7540'>novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road; so to these</div><div class='line' id='LC7541'>places we confined ourselves.  Yes, he certainly did the best he</div><div class='line' id='LC7542'>could, but what of that?

I didn&#39;t quite know</div><div class='line' id='LC7572'>how to take hold of it, or what to say, and so, of course, I ended</div><div class='line' id='LC7573'>by saying the natural thing:</div><div class='line' id='LC7574'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7575'>&quot;But, sire, how can I know what your thoughts are?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7576'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7577'>The king stopped dead in his tracks, and stared at me.</div><div class='line' id='LC7578'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7579'>&quot;I believed thou wert greater than Merlin; and truly in magic</div><div class='line' id='LC7580'>thou art.  But prophecy is greater than magic.  Merlin is a prophet.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7581'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7582'>I saw I had made a blunder.  I must get back my lost ground.</div><div class='line' id='LC7583'>After a deep reflection and careful planning, I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC7584'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7585'>&quot;Sire, I have been misunderstood.  I will explain.  There are two</div><div class='line' id='LC7586'>kinds of prophecy.  One is the gift to foretell things that are but</div><div class='line' id='LC7587'>a little way off, the other is the gift to foretell things that</div><div class='line' id='LC7588'>are whole ages and centuries away.  Which is the mightier gift,</div><div class='line' id='LC7589'>do you think?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7590'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7591'>&quot;Oh, the last, most surely!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7592'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7593'>&quot;True.  Does Merlin possess it?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7594'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7595'>&quot;Partly, yes.  He foretold mysteries about my birth and future</div><div class='line' id='LC7596'>kingship that were twenty years away.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7597'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7598'>&quot;Has he ever gone beyond that?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7599'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7600'>&quot;He would not claim more, I think.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7601'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7602'>&quot;It is probably his limit.  All prophets have their limit.  The limit</div><div class='line' id='LC7603'>of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7604'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7605'>&quot;These are few, I ween.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7606'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7607'>&quot;There have been two still greater ones, whose limit was four</div><div class='line' id='LC7608'>hundred and six hundred years, and one whose limit compassed</div><div class='line' id='LC7609'>even seven hundred and twenty.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7610'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7611'>&quot;Gramercy, it is marvelous!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7612'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7613'>&quot;But what are these in comparison with me?  They are nothing.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7614'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7615'>&quot;What?  Canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch</div><div class='line' id='LC7616'>of time as--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7617'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7618'>&quot;Seven hundred years?  My liege, as clear as the vision of an eagle</div><div class='line' id='LC7619'>does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this</div><div class='line' id='LC7620'>world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7621'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7622'>My land, you should have seen the king&#39;s eyes spread slowly open,</div><div class='line' id='LC7623'>and lift the earth&#39;s entire atmosphere as much as an inch!  That</div><div class='line' id='LC7624'>settled Brer Merlin.  One never had any occasion to prove his</div><div class='line' id='LC7625'>facts, with these people; all he had to do was to state them.  It</div><div class='line' id='LC7626'>never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement.</div><div class='line' id='LC7627'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7628'>&quot;Now, then,&quot; I continued, &quot;I _could_ work both kinds of prophecy</div><div class='line' id='LC7629'>--the long and the short--if I chose to take the trouble to keep</div><div class='line' id='LC7630'>in practice; but I seldom exercise any but the long kind, because</div><div class='line' id='LC7631'>the other is beneath my dignity.  It is properer to Merlin&#39;s sort</div><div class='line' id='LC7632'>--stump-tail prophets, as we call them in the profession.  Of course,</div><div class='line' id='LC7633'>I whet up now and then and flirt out a minor prophecy, but not</div><div class='line' id='LC7634'>often--hardly ever, in fact.  You will remember that there was</div><div class='line' id='LC7635'>great talk, when you reached the Valley of Holiness, about my</div><div class='line' id='LC7636'>having prophesied your coming and the very hour of your arrival,</div><div class='line' id='LC7637'>two or three days beforehand.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7638'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7639'>&quot;Indeed, yes, I mind it now.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7640'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7641'>&quot;Well, I could have done it as much as forty times easier, and</div><div class='line' id='LC7642'>piled on a thousand times more detail into the bargain, if it had</div><div class='line' id='LC7643'>been five hundred years away instead of two or three days.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7644'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7645'>&quot;How amazing that it should be so!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7646'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7647'>&quot;Yes, a genuine expert can always foretell a thing that is five</div><div class='line' id='LC7648'>hundred years away easier than he can a thing that&#39;s only five</div><div class='line' id='LC7649'>hundred seconds off.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7650'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7651'>&quot;And yet in reason it should clearly be the other way; it should</div><div class='line' id='LC7652'>be five hundred times as easy to foretell the last as the first,</div><div class='line' id='LC7653'>for, indeed, it is so close by that one uninspired might almost</div><div class='line' id='LC7654'>see it.  In truth, the law of prophecy doth contradict the likelihoods,</div><div class='line' id='LC7655'>most strangely making the difficult easy, and the easy difficult.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7656'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7657'>It was a wise head.  A peasant&#39;s cap was no safe disguise for it;</div><div class='line' id='LC7658'>you could know it for a king&#39;s under a diving-bell, if you could</div><div class='line' id='LC7659'>hear it work its intellect.</div><div class='line' id='LC7660'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7661'>I had a new trade now, and plenty of business in it.  The king</div><div class='line' id='LC7662'>was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen</div><div class='line' id='LC7663'>during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live</div><div class='line' id='LC7664'>in them.  From that time out, I prophesied myself bald-headed</div><div class='line' id='LC7665'>trying to supply the demand.  I have done some indiscreet things in</div><div class='line' id='LC7666'>my day, but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the</div><div class='line' id='LC7667'>worst.  Still, it had its ameliorations.  A prophet doesn&#39;t have</div><div class='line' id='LC7668'>to have any brains.  They are good to have, of course, for the</div><div class='line' id='LC7669'>ordinary exigencies of life, but they are no use in professional</div><div class='line' id='LC7670'>work.  It is the restfulest vocation there is.  When the spirit of</div><div class='line' id='LC7671'>prophecy comes upon you, you merely cake your intellect and lay it</div><div class='line' id='LC7672'>off in a cool place for a rest, and unship your jaw and leave it</div><div class='line' id='LC7673'>alone; it will work itself: the result is prophecy.</div><div class='line' id='LC7674'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7675'>Every day a knight-errant or so came along, and the sight of them</div><div class='line' id='LC7676'>fired the king&#39;s martial spirit every time.  He would have forgotten</div><div class='line' id='LC7677'>himself, sure, and said something to them in a style a suspicious</div><div class='line' id='LC7678'>shade or so above his ostensible degree, and so I always got him</div><div class='line' id='LC7679'>well out of the road in time.  Then he would stand and look with</div><div class='line' id='LC7680'>all his eyes; and a proud light would flash from them, and his</div><div class='line' id='LC7681'>nostrils would inflate like a war-horse&#39;s, and I knew he was</div><div class='line' id='LC7682'>longing for a brush with them.  But about noon of the third day</div><div class='line' id='LC7683'>I had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been</div><div class='line' id='LC7684'>suggested by the whip-stroke that had fallen to my share two days</div><div class='line' id='LC7685'>before; a precaution which I had afterward decided to leave untaken,</div><div class='line' id='LC7686'>I was so loath to institute it; but now I had just had a fresh</div><div class='line' id='LC7687'>reminder: while striding heedlessly along, with jaw spread and</div><div class='line' id='LC7688'>intellect at rest, for I was prophesying, I stubbed my toe and</div><div class='line' id='LC7689'>fell sprawling.  I was so pale I couldn&#39;t think for a moment;</div><div class='line' id='LC7690'>then I got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack.</div><div class='line' id='LC7691'>I had that dynamite bomb in it, done up in wool in a box.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC7692'>a good thing to have along; the time would come when I could do</div><div class='line' id='LC7693'>a valuable miracle with it, maybe, but it was a nervous thing</div><div class='line' id='LC7694'>to have about me, and I didn&#39;t like to ask the king to carry it.</div><div class='line' id='LC7695'>Yet I must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get</div><div class='line' id='LC7696'>along with its society.  I got it out and slipped it into my scrip,</div><div class='line' id='LC7697'>and just then here came a couple of knights.  The king stood,</div><div class='line' id='LC7698'>stately as a statue, gazing toward them--had forgotten himself again,</div><div class='line' id='LC7699'>of course--and before I could get a word of warning out, it was</div><div class='line' id='LC7700'>time for him to skip, and well that he did it, too.  He supposed</div><div class='line' id='LC7701'>they would turn aside.  Turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt</div><div class='line' id='LC7702'>under foot?  When had he ever turned aside himself--or ever had</div><div class='line' id='LC7703'>the chance to do it, if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight</div><div class='line' id='LC7704'>in time to judiciously save him the trouble?  The knights paid</div><div class='line' id='LC7705'>no attention to the king at all; it was his place to look out</div><div class='line' id='LC7706'>himself, and if he hadn&#39;t skipped he would have been placidly</div><div class='line' id='LC7707'>ridden down, and laughed at besides.</div><div class='line' id='LC7708'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7709'>The king was in a flaming fury, and launched out his challenge</div><div class='line' id='LC7710'>and epithets with a most royal vigor.  The knights were some little</div><div class='line' id='LC7711'>distance by now.  They halted, greatly surprised, and turned in</div><div class='line' id='LC7712'>their saddles and looked back, as if wondering if it might be worth</div><div class='line' id='LC7713'>while to bother with such scum as we.  Then they wheeled and</div><div class='line' id='LC7714'>started for us.  Not a moment must be lost.  I started for _them_.</div><div class='line' id='LC7715'>I passed them at a rattling gait, and as I went by I flung out a</div><div class='line' id='LC7716'>hair-lifting soul-scorching thirteen-jointed insult which made</div><div class='line' id='LC7717'>the king&#39;s effort poor and cheap by comparison.  I got it out of</div><div class='line' id='LC7718'>the nineteenth century where they know how.  They had such headway</div><div class='line' id='LC7719'>that they were nearly to the king before they could check up;</div><div class='line' id='LC7720'>then, frantic with rage, they stood up their horses on their hind</div><div class='line' id='LC7721'>hoofs and whirled them around, and the next moment here they came,</div><div class='line' id='LC7722'>breast to breast.  I was seventy yards off, then, and scrambling up</div><div class='line' id='LC7723'>a great bowlder at the roadside.  When they were within thirty</div><div class='line' id='LC7724'>yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level, depressed</div><div class='line' id='LC7725'>their mailed heads, and so, with their horse-hair plumes streaming</div><div class='line' id='LC7726'>straight out behind, most gallant to see, this lightning express</div><div class='line' id='LC7727'>came tearing for me!  When they were within fifteen yards, I sent</div><div class='line' id='LC7728'>that bomb with a sure aim, and it struck the ground just under</div><div class='line' id='LC7729'>the horses&#39; noses.</div><div class='line' id='LC7730'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7731'>Yes, it was a neat thing, very neat and pretty to see.  It resembled</div><div class='line' id='LC7732'>a steamboat explosion on the Mississippi; and during the next</div><div class='line' id='LC7733'>fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic</div><div class='line' id='LC7734'>fragments of knights and hardware and horse-flesh.  I say we,</div><div class='line' id='LC7735'>for the king joined the audience, of course, as soon as he had got</div><div class='line' id='LC7736'>his breath again.  There was a hole there which would afford steady</div><div class='line' id='LC7737'>work for all the people in that region for some years to come</div><div class='line' id='LC7738'>--in trying to explain it, I mean; as for filling it up, that service</div><div class='line' id='LC7739'>would be comparatively prompt, and would fall to the lot of a</div><div class='line' id='LC7740'>select few--peasants of that seignory; and they wouldn&#39;t get</div><div class='line' id='LC7741'>anything for it, either.</div><div class='line' id='LC7742'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7743'>But I explained it to the king myself. I said it was done with a</div><div class='line' id='LC7744'>dynamite bomb.  This information did him no damage, because it</div><div class='line' id='LC7745'>left him as intelligent as he was before.  However, it was a noble</div><div class='line' id='LC7746'>miracle, in his eyes, and was another settler for Merlin.  I thought</div><div class='line' id='LC7747'>it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort</div><div class='line' id='LC7748'>that it couldn&#39;t be done except when the atmospheric conditions</div><div class='line' id='LC7749'>were just right.  Otherwise he would be encoring it every time we</div><div class='line' id='LC7750'>had a good subject, and that would be inconvenient, because I</div><div class='line' id='LC7751'>hadn&#39;t any more bombs along.</div><div class='line' id='LC7752'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7753'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7754'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7755'>CHAPTER XXVIII</div><div class='line' id='LC7756'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7757'>DRILLING THE KING</div><div class='line' id='LC7758'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7759'>On the morning of the fourth day, when it was just sunrise, and we</div><div class='line' id='LC7760'>had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn, I came to a resolution:</div><div class='line' id='LC7761'>the king _must_ be drilled; things could not go on so, he must be</div><div class='line' id='LC7762'>taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled, or we</div><div class='line' id='LC7763'>couldn&#39;t ever venture to enter a dwelling; the very cats would know</div><div class='line' id='LC7764'>this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant.  So I called a halt</div><div class='line' id='LC7765'>and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC7766'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7767'>&quot;Sire, as between clothes and countenance, you are all right, there</div><div class='line' id='LC7768'>is no discrepancy; but as between your clothes and your bearing,</div><div class='line' id='LC7769'>you are all wrong, there is a most noticeable discrepancy.  Your</div><div class='line' id='LC7770'>soldierly stride, your lordly port--these will not do.  You stand</div><div class='line' id='LC7771'>too straight, your looks are too high, too confident.  The cares</div><div class='line' id='LC7772'>of a kingdom do not stoop the shoulders, they do not droop the chin,</div><div class='line' id='LC7773'>they do not depress the high level of the eye-glance, they do not</div><div class='line' id='LC7774'>put doubt and fear in the heart and hang out the signs of them</div><div class='line' id='LC7775'>in slouching body and unsure step.  It is the sordid cares of</div><div class='line' id='LC7776'>the lowly born that do these things.  You must learn the trick;</div><div class='line' id='LC7777'>you must imitate the trademarks of poverty, misery, oppression,</div><div class='line' id='LC7778'>insult, and the other several and common inhumanities that sap</div><div class='line' id='LC7779'>the manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and</div><div class='line' id='LC7780'>approved subject and a satisfaction to his masters, or the very</div><div class='line' id='LC7781'>infants will know you for better than your disguise, and we shall go</div><div class='line' id='LC7782'>to pieces at the first hut we stop at.  Pray try to walk like this.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7783'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7784'>The king took careful note, and then tried an imitation.</div><div class='line' id='LC7785'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7786'>&quot;Pretty fair--pretty fair.  Chin a little lower, please--there, very</div><div class='line' id='LC7787'>good.  Eyes too high; pray don&#39;t look at the horizon, look at the</div><div class='line' id='LC7788'>ground, ten steps in front of you.  Ah--that is better, that is</div><div class='line' id='LC7789'>very good.  Wait, please; you betray too much vigor, too much</div><div class='line' id='LC7790'>decision; you want more of a shamble.  Look at me, please--this is</div><div class='line' id='LC7791'>what I mean....  Now you are getting it; that is the idea--at least,</div><div class='line' id='LC7792'>it sort of approaches it....  Yes, that is pretty fair.  _But!_</div><div class='line' id='LC7793'>There is a great big something wanting, I don&#39;t quite know what</div><div class='line' id='LC7794'>it is.  Please walk thirty yards, so that I can get a perspective</div><div class='line' id='LC7795'>on the thing....  Now, then--your head&#39;s right, speed&#39;s right,</div><div class='line' id='LC7796'>shoulders right, eyes right, chin right, gait, carriage, general</div><div class='line' id='LC7797'>style right--everything&#39;s right!  And yet the fact remains, the</div><div class='line' id='LC7798'>aggregate&#39;s wrong.  The account don&#39;t balance.  Do it again,</div><div class='line' id='LC7799'>please....  _Now_ I think I begin to see what it is.  Yes, I&#39;ve</div><div class='line' id='LC7800'>struck it.  You see, the genuine spiritlessness is wanting; that&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC7801'>what&#39;s the trouble.  It&#39;s all _amateur_--mechanical details all</div><div class='line' id='LC7802'>right, almost to a hair; everything about the delusion perfect,</div><div class='line' id='LC7803'>except that it don&#39;t delude.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7804'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7805'>&quot;What, then, must one do, to prevail?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7806'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7807'>&quot;Let me think...

This is</div><div class='line' id='LC7809'>a good place for it: roots and stony ground to break up your</div><div class='line' id='LC7810'>stately gait, a region not liable to interruption, only one field</div><div class='line' id='LC7811'>and one hut in sight, and they so far away that nobody could</div><div class='line' id='LC7812'>see us from there.  It will be well to move a little off the road</div><div class='line' id='LC7813'>and put in the whole day drilling you, sire.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7814'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7815'>After the drill had gone on a little while, I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC7816'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7817'>&quot;Now, sire, imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder,</div><div class='line' id='LC7818'>and the family are before us.

Why, they really think that, you know, because they</div><div class='line' id='LC7908'>know all about the one, but haven&#39;t tried the other.  But I know</div><div class='line' id='LC7909'>all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there isn&#39;t money</div><div class='line' id='LC7910'>enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days,</div><div class='line' id='LC7911'>but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as</div><div class='line' id='LC7912'>near nothing as you can cipher it down--and I will be satisfied, too.</div><div class='line' id='LC7913'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7914'>Intellectual &quot;work&quot; is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation,</div><div class='line' id='LC7915'>and is its own highest reward.

The field near by had been denuded of its crop</div><div class='line' id='LC7936'>some time before, and had a skinned look, so exhaustively had</div><div class='line' id='LC7937'>it been harvested and gleaned.  Fences, sheds, everything had a</div><div class='line' id='LC7938'>ruined look, and were eloquent of poverty.  No animal was around</div><div class='line' id='LC7939'>anywhere, no living thing in sight.  The stillness was awful, it</div><div class='line' id='LC7940'>was like the stillness of death.  The cabin was a one-story one,</div><div class='line' id='LC7941'>whose thatch was black with age, and ragged from lack of repair.</div><div class='line' id='LC7942'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7943'>The door stood a trifle ajar.

The king knocked.  We waited.  No answer.  Knocked</div><div class='line' id='LC7946'>again.  No answer.  I pushed the door softly open and looked in.</div><div class='line' id='LC7947'>I made out some dim forms, and a woman started up from the ground</div><div class='line' id='LC7948'>and stared at me, as one does who is wakened from sleep.  Presently</div><div class='line' id='LC7949'>she found her voice:</div><div class='line' id='LC7950'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7951'>&quot;Have mercy!&quot; she pleaded.  &quot;All is taken, nothing is left.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7952'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7953'>&quot;I have not come to take anything, poor woman.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7954'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7955'>&quot;You are not a priest?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7956'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7957'>&quot;No.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7958'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7959'>&quot;Nor come not from the lord of the manor?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7960'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7961'>&quot;No, I am a stranger.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7962'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7963'>&quot;Oh, then, for the fear of God, who visits with misery and death</div><div class='line' id='LC7964'>such as be harmless, tarry not here, but fly!

It was ten yards away.</div><div class='line' id='LC7987'>When I got back and entered, the king was within, and was opening</div><div class='line' id='LC7988'>the shutter that closed the window-hole, to let in air and light.</div><div class='line' id='LC7989'>The place was full of a foul stench.  I put the bowl to the woman&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC7990'>lips, and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came</div><div class='line' id='LC7991'>open and a strong light flooded her face.  Smallpox!</div><div class='line' id='LC7992'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7993'>I sprang to the king, and said in his ear:</div><div class='line' id='LC7994'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7995'>&quot;Out of the door on the instant, sire! the woman is dying of that</div><div class='line' id='LC7996'>disease that wasted the skirts of Camelot two years ago.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC7997'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC7998'>He did not budge.</div><div class='line' id='LC7999'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8000'>&quot;Of a truth I shall remain--and likewise help.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8001'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8002'>I whispered again:</div><div class='line' id='LC8003'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8004'>&quot;King, it must not be.  You must go.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8005'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8006'>&quot;Ye mean well, and ye speak not unwisely.  But it were shame that</div><div class='line' id='LC8007'>a king should know fear, and shame that belted knight should</div><div class='line' id='LC8008'>withhold his hand where be such as need succor.  Peace, I will</div><div class='line' id='LC8009'>not go.  It is you who must go.  The Church&#39;s ban is not upon me,</div><div class='line' id='LC8010'>but it forbiddeth you to be here, and she will deal with you with</div><div class='line' id='LC8011'>a heavy hand an word come to her of your trespass.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8012'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8013'>It was a desperate place for him to be in, and might cost him his</div><div class='line' id='LC8014'>life, but it was no use to argue with him.  If he considered his</div><div class='line' id='LC8015'>knightly honor at stake here, that was the end of argument; he</div><div class='line' id='LC8016'>would stay, and nothing could prevent it; I was aware of that.</div><div class='line' id='LC8017'>And so I dropped the subject.  The woman spoke:</div><div class='line' id='LC8018'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8019'>&quot;Fair sir, of your kindness will ye climb the ladder there,</div><div class='line' id='LC8020'>and bring me news of what ye find?

I will go.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8025'>And he put down the knapsack.</div><div class='line' id='LC8026'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8027'>I turned to start, but the king had already started.  He halted,</div><div class='line' id='LC8028'>and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light, and had not</div><div class='line' id='LC8029'>noticed us thus far, or spoken.</div><div class='line' id='LC8030'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8031'>&quot;Is it your husband?&quot; the king asked.</div><div class='line' id='LC8032'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8033'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8034'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8035'>&quot;Is he asleep?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8036'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8037'>&quot;God be thanked for that one charity, yes--these three hours.</div><div class='line' id='LC8038'>Where shall I pay to the full, my gratitude! for my heart is</div><div class='line' id='LC8039'>bursting with it for that sleep he sleepeth now.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8040'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8041'>I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8042'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8043'>&quot;We will be careful.  We will not wake him.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8044'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8045'>&quot;Ah, no, that ye will not, for he is dead.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8046'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8047'>&quot;Dead?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8048'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8049'>&quot;Yes, what triumph it is to know it!  None can harm him, none</div><div class='line' id='LC8050'>insult him more.  He is in heaven now, and happy; or if not there,</div><div class='line' id='LC8051'>he bides in hell and is content; for in that place he will find</div><div class='line' id='LC8052'>neither abbot nor yet bishop.  We were boy and girl together; we</div><div class='line' id='LC8053'>were man and wife these five and twenty years, and never separated</div><div class='line' id='LC8054'>till this day.  Think how long that is to love and suffer together.</div><div class='line' id='LC8055'>This morning was he out of his mind, and in his fancy we were</div><div class='line' id='LC8056'>boy and girl again and wandering in the happy fields; and so in</div><div class='line' id='LC8057'>that innocent glad converse wandered he far and farther, still</div><div class='line' id='LC8058'>lightly gossiping, and entered into those other fields we know</div><div class='line' id='LC8059'>not of, and was shut away from mortal sight.  And so there was</div><div class='line' id='LC8060'>no parting, for in his fancy I went with him; he knew not but</div><div class='line' id='LC8061'>I went with him, my hand in his--my young soft hand, not this</div><div class='line' id='LC8062'>withered claw.  Ah, yes, to go, and know it not; to separate and</div><div class='line' id='LC8063'>know it not; how could one go peace--fuller than that?  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC8064'>his reward for a cruel life patiently borne.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8065'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8066'>There was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where</div><div class='line' id='LC8067'>the ladder was.  It was the king descending.  I could see that he</div><div class='line' id='LC8068'>was bearing something in one arm, and assisting himself with the</div><div class='line' id='LC8069'>other.  He came forward into the light; upon his breast lay a</div><div class='line' id='LC8070'>slender girl of fifteen.  She was but half conscious; she was dying</div><div class='line' id='LC8071'>of smallpox.  Here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility,</div><div class='line' id='LC8072'>its utmost summit; this was challenging death in the open field</div><div class='line' id='LC8073'>unarmed, with all the odds against the challenger, no reward set</div><div class='line' id='LC8074'>upon the contest, and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold</div><div class='line' id='LC8075'>to gaze and applaud; and yet the king&#39;s bearing was as serenely</div><div class='line' id='LC8076'>brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight</div><div class='line' id='LC8077'>meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC8078'>was great now; sublimely great.  The rude statues of his ancestors</div><div class='line' id='LC8079'>in his palace should have an addition--I would see to that; and it</div><div class='line' id='LC8080'>would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon, like the</div><div class='line' id='LC8081'>rest, it would be a king in commoner&#39;s garb bearing death in his</div><div class='line' id='LC8082'>arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and</div><div class='line' id='LC8083'>be comforted.</div><div class='line' id='LC8084'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8085'>He laid the girl down by her mother, who poured out endearments</div><div class='line' id='LC8086'>and caresses from an overflowing heart, and one could detect a</div><div class='line' id='LC8087'>flickering faint light of response in the child&#39;s eyes, but that</div><div class='line' id='LC8088'>was all.  The mother hung over her, kissing her, petting her, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8089'>imploring her to speak, but the lips only moved and no sound came.</div><div class='line' id='LC8090'>I snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack, but the woman forbade</div><div class='line' id='LC8091'>me, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8092'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8093'>&quot;No--she does not suffer; it is better so.  It might bring her back</div><div class='line' id='LC8094'>to life.  None that be so good and kind as ye are would do her</div><div class='line' id='LC8095'>that cruel hurt.  For look you--what is left to live for?  Her</div><div class='line' id='LC8096'>brothers are gone, her father is gone, her mother goeth, the</div><div class='line' id='LC8097'>Church&#39;s curse is upon her, and none may shelter or befriend her</div><div class='line' id='LC8098'>even though she lay perishing in the road.  She is desolate.  I have</div><div class='line' id='LC8099'>not asked you, good heart, if her sister be still on live, here</div><div class='line' id='LC8100'>overhead; I had no need; ye had gone back, else, and not left</div><div class='line' id='LC8101'>the poor thing forsaken--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8102'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8103'>&quot;She lieth at peace,&quot; interrupted the king, in a subdued voice.</div><div class='line' id='LC8104'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8105'>&quot;I would not change it.  How rich is this day in happiness!  Ah,</div><div class='line' id='LC8106'>my Annis, thou shalt join thy sister soon--thou&#39;rt on thy way,</div><div class='line' id='LC8107'>and these be merciful friends that will not hinder.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8108'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8109'>And so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8110'>softly stroking her face and hair, and kissing her and calling her</div><div class='line' id='LC8111'>by endearing names; but there was scarcely sign of response now</div><div class='line' id='LC8112'>in the glazing eyes.  I saw tears well from the king&#39;s eyes, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8113'>trickle down his face.  The woman noticed them, too, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8114'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8115'>&quot;Ah, I know that sign: thou&#39;st a wife at home, poor soul, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8116'>you and she have gone hungry to bed, many&#39;s the time, that the</div><div class='line' id='LC8117'>little ones might have your crust; you know what poverty is, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8118'>the daily insults of your betters, and the heavy hand of the Church</div><div class='line' id='LC8119'>and the king.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8120'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8121'>The king winced under this accidental home-shot, but kept still;</div><div class='line' id='LC8122'>he was learning his part; and he was playing it well, too, for</div><div class='line' id='LC8123'>a pretty dull beginner.  I struck up a diversion.  I offered the</div><div class='line' id='LC8124'>woman food and liquor, but she refused both.  She would allow</div><div class='line' id='LC8125'>nothing to come between her and the release of death.  Then I slipped</div><div class='line' id='LC8126'>away and brought the dead child from aloft, and laid it by her.</div><div class='line' id='LC8127'>This broke her down again, and there was another scene that was</div><div class='line' id='LC8128'>full of heartbreak.  By and by I made another diversion, and beguiled</div><div class='line' id='LC8129'>her to sketch her story.</div><div class='line' id='LC8130'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8131'>&quot;Ye know it well yourselves, having suffered it--for truly none</div><div class='line' id='LC8132'>of our condition in Britain escape it.  It is the old, weary tale.</div><div class='line' id='LC8133'>We fought and struggled and succeeded; meaning by success, that</div><div class='line' id='LC8134'>we lived and did not die; more than that is not to be claimed.  No</div><div class='line' id='LC8135'>troubles came that we could not outlive, till this year brought</div><div class='line' id='LC8136'>them; then came they all at once, as one might say, and overwhelmed</div><div class='line' id='LC8137'>us.  Years ago the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on</div><div class='line' id='LC8138'>our farm; in the best part of it, too--a grievous wrong and shame--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8139'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8140'>&quot;But it was his right,&quot; interrupted the king.</div><div class='line' id='LC8141'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8142'>&quot;None denieth that, indeed; an the law mean anything, what is</div><div class='line' id='LC8143'>the lord&#39;s is his, and what is mine is his also.  Our farm was</div><div class='line' id='LC8144'>ours by lease, therefore &#39;twas likewise his, to do with it as he</div><div class='line' id='LC8145'>would.  Some little time ago, three of those trees were found hewn</div><div class='line' id='LC8146'>down.  Our three grown sons ran frightened to report the crime.</div><div class='line' id='LC8147'>Well, in his lordship&#39;s dungeon there they lie, who saith there</div><div class='line' id='LC8148'>shall they lie and rot till they confess.  They have naught to</div><div class='line' id='LC8149'>confess, being innocent, wherefore there will they remain until</div><div class='line' id='LC8150'>they die.  Ye know that right well, I ween.  Think how this left us;</div><div class='line' id='LC8151'>a man, a woman and two children, to gather a crop that was planted</div><div class='line' id='LC8152'>by so much greater force, yes, and protect it night and day from</div><div class='line' id='LC8153'>pigeons and prowling animals that be sacred and must not be hurt</div><div class='line' id='LC8154'>by any of our sort.  When my lord&#39;s crop was nearly ready for</div><div class='line' id='LC8155'>the harvest, so also was ours; when his bell rang to call us to</div><div class='line' id='LC8156'>his fields to harvest his crop for nothing, he would not allow that</div><div class='line' id='LC8157'>I and my two girls should count for our three captive sons, but</div><div class='line' id='LC8158'>for only two of them; so, for the lacking one were we daily fined.</div><div class='line' id='LC8159'>All this time our own crop was perishing through neglect; and so</div><div class='line' id='LC8160'>both the priest and his lordship fined us because their shares</div><div class='line' id='LC8161'>of it were suffering through damage.  In the end the fines ate up</div><div class='line' id='LC8162'>our crop--and they took it all; they took it all and made us harvest</div><div class='line' id='LC8163'>it for them, without pay or food, and we starving.  Then the worst</div><div class='line' id='LC8164'>came when I, being out of my mind with hunger and loss of my boys,</div><div class='line' id='LC8165'>and grief to see my husband and my little maids in rags and misery</div><div class='line' id='LC8166'>and despair, uttered a deep blasphemy--oh! a thousand of them!</div><div class='line' id='LC8167'>--against the Church and the Church&#39;s ways.  It was ten days ago.</div><div class='line' id='LC8168'>I had fallen sick with this disease, and it was to the priest</div><div class='line' id='LC8169'>I said the words, for he was come to chide me for lack of due</div><div class='line' id='LC8170'>humility under the chastening hand of God.  He carried my trespass</div><div class='line' id='LC8171'>to his betters; I was stubborn; wherefore, presently upon my head</div><div class='line' id='LC8172'>and upon all heads that were dear to me, fell the curse of Rome.</div><div class='line' id='LC8173'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8174'>&quot;Since that day we are avoided, shunned with horror.  None has</div><div class='line' id='LC8175'>come near this hut to know whether we live or not.  The rest of us</div><div class='line' id='LC8176'>were taken down.  Then I roused me and got up, as wife and mother</div><div class='line' id='LC8177'>will.  It was little they could have eaten in any case; it was</div><div class='line' id='LC8178'>less than little they had to eat.  But there was water, and I gave</div><div class='line' id='LC8179'>them that.  How they craved it! and how they blessed it!  But the</div><div class='line' id='LC8180'>end came yesterday; my strength broke down.  Yesterday was the</div><div class='line' id='LC8181'>last time I ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive.</div><div class='line' id='LC8182'>I have lain here all these hours--these ages, ye may say--listening,</div><div class='line' id='LC8183'>listening for any sound up there that--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8184'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8185'>She gave a sharp quick glance at her eldest daughter, then cried</div><div class='line' id='LC8186'>out, &quot;Oh, my darling!&quot; and feebly gathered the stiffening form</div><div class='line' id='LC8187'>to her sheltering arms.  She had recognized the death-rattle.</div><div class='line' id='LC8188'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8189'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8190'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8191'>CHAPTER XXX</div><div class='line' id='LC8192'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8193'>THE TRAGEDY OF THE MANOR-HOUSE</div><div class='line' id='LC8194'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8195'>At midnight all was over, and we sat in the presence of four</div><div class='line' id='LC8196'>corpses.  We covered them with such rags as we could find, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8197'>started away, fastening the door behind us.  Their home must be</div><div class='line' id='LC8198'>these people&#39;s grave, for they could not have Christian burial,</div><div class='line' id='LC8199'>or be admitted to consecrated ground.  They were as dogs, wild</div><div class='line' id='LC8200'>beasts, lepers, and no soul that valued its hope of eternal life</div><div class='line' id='LC8201'>would throw it away by meddling in any sort with these rebuked and</div><div class='line' id='LC8202'>smitten outcasts.</div><div class='line' id='LC8203'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8204'>We had not moved four steps when I caught a sound as of footsteps</div><div class='line' id='LC8205'>upon gravel.  My heart flew to my throat.  We must not be seen</div><div class='line' id='LC8206'>coming from that house.  I plucked at the king&#39;s robe and we drew</div><div class='line' id='LC8207'>back and took shelter behind the corner of the cabin.</div><div class='line' id='LC8208'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8209'>&quot;Now we are safe,&quot; I said, &quot;but it was a close call--so to speak.</div><div class='line' id='LC8210'>If the night had been lighter he might have seen us, no doubt,</div><div class='line' id='LC8211'>he seemed to be so near.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8212'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8213'>&quot;Mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8214'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8215'>&quot;True.  But man or beast, it will be wise to stay here a minute</div><div class='line' id='LC8216'>and let it get by and out of the way.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8217'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8218'>&quot;Hark!  It cometh hither.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8219'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8220'>True again.  The step was coming toward us--straight toward the hut.</div><div class='line' id='LC8221'>It must be a beast, then, and we might as well have saved our</div><div class='line' id='LC8222'>trepidation.  I was going to step out, but the king laid his hand</div><div class='line' id='LC8223'>upon my arm.  There was a moment of silence, then we heard a soft</div><div class='line' id='LC8224'>knock on the cabin door.  It made me shiver.  Presently the knock</div><div class='line' id='LC8225'>was repeated, and then we heard these words in a guarded voice:</div><div class='line' id='LC8226'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8227'>&quot;Mother!  Father!  Open--we have got free, and we bring news to</div><div class='line' id='LC8228'>pale your cheeks but glad your hearts; and we may not tarry, but</div><div class='line' id='LC8229'>must fly!  And--but they answer not.  Mother! father!--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8230'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8231'>I drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered:</div><div class='line' id='LC8232'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8233'>&quot;Come--now we can get to the road.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8234'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8235'>The king hesitated, was going to demur; but just then we heard</div><div class='line' id='LC8236'>the door give way, and knew that those desolate men were in the</div><div class='line' id='LC8237'>presence of their dead.</div><div class='line' id='LC8238'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8239'>&quot;Come, my liege! in a moment they will strike a light, and then</div><div class='line' id='LC8240'>will follow that which it would break your heart to hear.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8241'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8242'>He did not hesitate this time.  The moment we were in the road</div><div class='line' id='LC8243'>I ran; and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed.</div><div class='line' id='LC8244'>I did not want to think of what was happening in the hut--I couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC8245'>bear it; I wanted to drive it out of my mind; so I struck into the</div><div class='line' id='LC8246'>first subject that lay under that one in my mind:</div><div class='line' id='LC8247'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8248'>&quot;I have had the disease those people died of, and so have nothing</div><div class='line' id='LC8249'>to fear; but if you have not had it also--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8250'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8251'>He broke in upon me to say he was in trouble, and it was his</div><div class='line' id='LC8252'>conscience that was troubling him:</div><div class='line' id='LC8253'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8254'>&quot;These young men have got free, they say--but _how_?  It is not</div><div class='line' id='LC8255'>likely that their lord hath set them free.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8256'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8257'>&quot;Oh, no, I make no doubt they escaped.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8258'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8259'>&quot;That is my trouble; I have a fear that this is so, and your</div><div class='line' id='LC8260'>suspicion doth confirm it, you having the same fear.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8261'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8262'>&quot;I should not call it by that name though.  I do suspect that they</div><div class='line' id='LC8263'>escaped, but if they did, I am not sorry, certainly.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8264'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8265'>&quot;I am not sorry, I _think_--but--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8266'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8267'>&quot;What is it?  What is there for one to be troubled about?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8268'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8269'>&quot;_If_ they did escape, then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon</div><div class='line' id='LC8270'>them and deliver them again to their lord; for it is not seemly</div><div class='line' id='LC8271'>that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed</div><div class='line' id='LC8272'>outrage from persons of their base degree.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8273'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8274'>There it was again.  He could see only one side of it.  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC8275'>born so, educated so, his veins were full of ancestral blood that</div><div class='line' id='LC8276'>was rotten with this sort of unconscious brutality, brought down</div><div class='line' id='LC8277'>by inheritance from a long procession of hearts that had each done</div><div class='line' id='LC8278'>its share toward poisoning the stream.  To imprison these men</div><div class='line' id='LC8279'>without proof, and starve their kindred, was no harm, for they were</div><div class='line' id='LC8280'>merely peasants and subject to the will and pleasure of their lord,</div><div class='line' id='LC8281'>no matter what fearful form it might take; but for these men to</div><div class='line' id='LC8282'>break out of unjust captivity was insult and outrage, and a thing</div><div class='line' id='LC8283'>not to be countenanced by any conscientious person who knew his</div><div class='line' id='LC8284'>duty to his sacred caste.</div><div class='line' id='LC8285'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8286'>I worked more than half an hour before I got him to change the</div><div class='line' id='LC8287'>subject--and even then an outside matter did it for me.  This was</div><div class='line' id='LC8288'>a something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a</div><div class='line' id='LC8289'>small hill--a red glow, a good way off.</div><div class='line' id='LC8290'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8291'>&quot;That&#39;s a fire,&quot; said I.</div><div class='line' id='LC8292'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8293'>Fires interested me considerably, because I was getting a good</div><div class='line' id='LC8294'>deal of an insurance business started, and was also training some</div><div class='line' id='LC8295'>horses and building some steam fire-engines, with an eye to a paid</div><div class='line' id='LC8296'>fire department by and by.  The priests opposed both my fire and</div><div class='line' id='LC8297'>life insurance, on the ground that it was an insolent attempt to</div><div class='line' id='LC8298'>hinder the decrees of God; and if you pointed out that they did not</div><div class='line' id='LC8299'>hinder the decrees in the least, but only modified the hard</div><div class='line' id='LC8300'>consequences of them if you took out policies and had luck, they</div><div class='line' id='LC8301'>retorted that that was gambling against the decrees of God, and was</div><div class='line' id='LC8302'>just as bad.  So they managed to damage those industries more</div><div class='line' id='LC8303'>or less, but I got even on my accident business.  As a rule, a knight</div><div class='line' id='LC8304'>is a lummux, and some times even a labrick, and hence open to pretty</div><div class='line' id='LC8305'>poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition-monger,</div><div class='line' id='LC8306'>but even _he_ could see the practical side of a thing once in a while;</div><div class='line' id='LC8307'>and so of late you couldn&#39;t clean up a tournament and pile the</div><div class='line' id='LC8308'>result without finding one of my accident-tickets in every helmet.</div><div class='line' id='LC8309'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8310'>We stood there awhile, in the thick darkness and stillness, looking</div><div class='line' id='LC8311'>toward the red blur in the distance, and trying to make out the</div><div class='line' id='LC8312'>meaning of a far-away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the</div><div class='line' id='LC8313'>night.  Sometimes it swelled up and for a moment seemed less</div><div class='line' id='LC8314'>remote; but when we were hopefully expecting it to betray its cause</div><div class='line' id='LC8315'>and nature, it dulled and sank again, carrying its mystery with it.</div><div class='line' id='LC8316'>We started down the hill in its direction, and the winding road</div><div class='line' id='LC8317'>plunged us at once into almost solid darkness--darkness that was</div><div class='line' id='LC8318'>packed and crammed in between two tall forest walls.  We groped</div><div class='line' id='LC8319'>along down for half a mile, perhaps, that murmur growing more and</div><div class='line' id='LC8320'>more distinct all the time.  The coming storm threatening more and</div><div class='line' id='LC8321'>more, with now and then a little shiver of wind, a faint show of</div><div class='line' id='LC8322'>lightning, and dull grumblings of distant thunder.  I was in the</div><div class='line' id='LC8323'>lead.  I ran against something--a soft heavy something which gave,</div><div class='line' id='LC8324'>slightly, to the impulse of my weight; at the same moment the</div><div class='line' id='LC8325'>lightning glared out, and within a foot of my face was the writhing</div><div class='line' id='LC8326'>face of a man who was hanging from the limb of a tree!  That is,</div><div class='line' id='LC8327'>it seemed to be writhing, but it was not.  It was a grewsome sight.</div><div class='line' id='LC8328'>Straightway there was an ear-splitting explosion of thunder, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8329'>the bottom of heaven fell out; the rain poured down in a deluge.</div><div class='line' id='LC8330'>No matter, we must try to cut this man down, on the chance that</div><div class='line' id='LC8331'>there might be life in him yet, mustn&#39;t we?  The lightning came</div><div class='line' id='LC8332'>quick and sharp now, and the place was alternately noonday and</div><div class='line' id='LC8333'>midnight.  One moment the man would be hanging before me in an</div><div class='line' id='LC8334'>intense light, and the next he was blotted out again in the darkness.</div><div class='line' id='LC8335'>I told the king we must cut him down.  The king at once objected.</div><div class='line' id='LC8336'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8337'>&quot;If he hanged himself, he was willing to lose him property to</div><div class='line' id='LC8338'>his lord; so let him be.  If others hanged him, belike they had</div><div class='line' id='LC8339'>the right--let him hang.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8340'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8341'>&quot;But--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8342'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8343'>&quot;But me no buts, but even leave him as he is.  And for yet another</div><div class='line' id='LC8344'>reason.  When the lightning cometh again--there, look abroad.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8345'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8346'>Two others hanging, within fifty yards of us!</div><div class='line' id='LC8347'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8348'>&quot;It is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk.</div><div class='line' id='LC8349'>They are past thanking you.  Come--it is unprofitable to tarry here.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8350'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8351'>There was reason in what he said, so we moved on.  Within the next</div><div class='line' id='LC8352'>mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning,</div><div class='line' id='LC8353'>and altogether it was a grisly excursion.  That murmur was a murmur</div><div class='line' id='LC8354'>no longer, it was a roar; a roar of men&#39;s voices.  A man came flying</div><div class='line' id='LC8355'>by now, dimly through the darkness, and other men chasing him.</div><div class='line' id='LC8356'>They disappeared.  Presently another case of the kind occurred,</div><div class='line' id='LC8357'>and then another and another.  Then a sudden turn of the road</div><div class='line' id='LC8358'>brought us in sight of that fire--it was a large manor-house, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8359'>little or nothing was left of it--and everywhere men were flying</div><div class='line' id='LC8360'>and other men raging after them in pursuit.</div><div class='line' id='LC8361'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8362'>I warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers.</div><div class='line' id='LC8363'>We would better get away from the light, until matters should</div><div class='line' id='LC8364'>improve.  We stepped back a little, and hid in the edge of the</div><div class='line' id='LC8365'>wood.  From this hiding-place we saw both men and women hunted</div><div class='line' id='LC8366'>by the mob.  The fearful work went on until nearly dawn.  Then,</div><div class='line' id='LC8367'>the fire being out and the storm spent, the voices and flying</div><div class='line' id='LC8368'>footsteps presently ceased, and darkness and stillness reigned again.</div><div class='line' id='LC8369'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8370'>We ventured out, and hurried cautiously away; and although we were</div><div class='line' id='LC8371'>worn out and sleepy, we kept on until we had put this place some</div><div class='line' id='LC8372'>miles behind us.  Then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal</div><div class='line' id='LC8373'>burner, and got what was to be had.  A woman was up and about, but</div><div class='line' id='LC8374'>the man was still asleep, on a straw shake-down, on the clay floor.</div><div class='line' id='LC8375'>The woman seemed uneasy until I explained that we were travelers</div><div class='line' id='LC8376'>and had lost our way and been wandering in the woods all night.</div><div class='line' id='LC8377'>She became talkative, then, and asked if we had heard of the</div><div class='line' id='LC8378'>terrible goings-on at the manor-house of Abblasoure.  Yes, we had</div><div class='line' id='LC8379'>heard of them, but what we wanted now was rest and sleep.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC8380'>king broke in:</div><div class='line' id='LC8381'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8382'>&quot;Sell us the house and take yourselves away, for we be perilous</div><div class='line' id='LC8383'>company, being late come from people that died of the Spotted Death.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8384'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8385'>It was good of him, but unnecessary.  One of the commonest decorations</div><div class='line' id='LC8386'>of the nation was the waffle-iron face.  I had early noticed that</div><div class='line' id='LC8387'>the woman and her husband were both so decorated.  She made us</div><div class='line' id='LC8388'>entirely welcome, and had no fears; and plainly she was immensely</div><div class='line' id='LC8389'>impressed by the king&#39;s proposition; for, of course, it was a good</div><div class='line' id='LC8390'>deal of an event in her life to run across a person of the king&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC8391'>humble appearance who was ready to buy a man&#39;s house for the sake</div><div class='line' id='LC8392'>of a night&#39;s lodging.  It gave her a large respect for us, and she</div><div class='line' id='LC8393'>strained the lean possibilities of her hovel to the utmost to make</div><div class='line' id='LC8394'>us comfortable.</div><div class='line' id='LC8395'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8396'>We slept till far into the afternoon, and then got up hungry enough to</div><div class='line' id='LC8397'>make cotter fare quite palatable to the king, the more particularly</div><div class='line' id='LC8398'>as it was scant in quantity.  And also in variety; it consisted</div><div class='line' id='LC8399'>solely of onions, salt, and the national black bread made out of</div><div class='line' id='LC8400'>horse-feed.  The woman told us about the affair of the evening</div><div class='line' id='LC8401'>before.  At ten or eleven at night, when everybody was in bed,</div><div class='line' id='LC8402'>the manor-house burst into flames.  The country-side swarmed to</div><div class='line' id='LC8403'>the rescue, and the family were saved, with one exception, the</div><div class='line' id='LC8404'>master.  He did not appear.  Everybody was frantic over this loss,</div><div class='line' id='LC8405'>and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking the</div><div class='line' id='LC8406'>burning house seeking that valuable personage.  But after a while</div><div class='line' id='LC8407'>he was found--what was left of him--which was his corpse.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC8408'>in a copse three hundred yards away, bound, gagged, stabbed in a</div><div class='line' id='LC8409'>dozen places.</div><div class='line' id='LC8410'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8411'>Who had done this?  Suspicion fell upon a humble family in the</div><div class='line' id='LC8412'>neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness</div><div class='line' id='LC8413'>by the baron; and from these people the suspicion easily extended</div><div class='line' id='LC8414'>itself to their relatives and familiars.  A suspicion was enough;</div><div class='line' id='LC8415'>my lord&#39;s liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against</div><div class='line' id='LC8416'>these people, and were promptly joined by the community in general.</div><div class='line' id='LC8417'>The woman&#39;s husband had been active with the mob, and had not</div><div class='line' id='LC8418'>returned home until nearly dawn.  He was gone now to find out</div><div class='line' id='LC8419'>what the general result had been.  While we were still talking he</div><div class='line' id='LC8420'>came back from his quest.  His report was revolting enough.  Eighteen</div><div class='line' id='LC8421'>persons hanged or butchered, and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners</div><div class='line' id='LC8422'>lost in the fire.</div><div class='line' id='LC8423'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8424'>&quot;And how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8425'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8426'>&quot;Thirteen.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8427'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8428'>&quot;Then every one of them was lost?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8429'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8430'>&quot;Yes, all.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8431'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8432'>&quot;But the people arrived in time to save the family; how is it they</div><div class='line' id='LC8433'>could save none of the prisoners?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8434'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8435'>The man looked puzzled, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8436'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8437'>&quot;Would one unlock the vaults at such a time?  Marry, some would</div><div class='line' id='LC8438'>have escaped.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8439'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8440'>&quot;Then you mean that nobody _did_ unlock them?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8441'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8442'>&quot;None went near them, either to lock or unlock.  It standeth to</div><div class='line' id='LC8443'>reason that the bolts were fast; wherefore it was only needful</div><div class='line' id='LC8444'>to establish a watch, so that if any broke the bonds he might not</div><div class='line' id='LC8445'>escape, but be taken. None were taken.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8446'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8447'>&quot;Natheless, three did escape,&quot; said the king, &quot;and ye will do well</div><div class='line' id='LC8448'>to publish it and set justice upon their track, for these murthered</div><div class='line' id='LC8449'>the baron and fired the house.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8450'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8451'>I was just expecting he would come out with that.  For a moment</div><div class='line' id='LC8452'>the man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and</div><div class='line' id='LC8453'>an impatience to go out and spread it; then a sudden something</div><div class='line' id='LC8454'>else betrayed itself in their faces, and they began to ask questions.</div><div class='line' id='LC8455'>I answered the questions myself, and narrowly watched the effects</div><div class='line' id='LC8456'>produced.  I was soon satisfied that the knowledge of who these</div><div class='line' id='LC8457'>three prisoners were had somehow changed the atmosphere; that</div><div class='line' id='LC8458'>our hosts&#39; continued eagerness to go and spread the news was now</div><div class='line' id='LC8459'>only pretended and not real.  The king did not notice the change,</div><div class='line' id='LC8460'>and I was glad of that.  I worked the conversation around toward</div><div class='line' id='LC8461'>other details of the night&#39;s proceedings, and noted that these</div><div class='line' id='LC8462'>people were relieved to have it take that direction.</div><div class='line' id='LC8463'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8464'>The painful thing observable about all this business was the</div><div class='line' id='LC8465'>alacrity with which this oppressed community had turned their</div><div class='line' id='LC8466'>cruel hands against their own class in the interest of the common</div><div class='line' id='LC8467'>oppressor.  This man and woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel</div><div class='line' id='LC8468'>between a person of their own class and his lord, it was the natural</div><div class='line' id='LC8469'>and proper and rightful thing for that poor devil&#39;s whole caste</div><div class='line' id='LC8470'>to side with the master and fight his battle for him, without ever</div><div class='line' id='LC8471'>stopping to inquire into the rights or wrongs of the matter.  This</div><div class='line' id='LC8472'>man had been out helping to hang his neighbors, and had done his</div><div class='line' id='LC8473'>work with zeal, and yet was aware that there was nothing against</div><div class='line' id='LC8474'>them but a mere suspicion, with nothing back of it describable</div><div class='line' id='LC8475'>as evidence, still neither he nor his wife seemed to see anything</div><div class='line' id='LC8476'>horrible about it.</div><div class='line' id='LC8477'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8478'>This was depressing--to a man with the dream of a republic in his</div><div class='line' id='LC8479'>head.  It reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away, when</div><div class='line' id='LC8480'>the &quot;poor whites&quot; of our South who were always despised and</div><div class='line' id='LC8481'>frequently insulted by the slave-lords around them, and who owed</div><div class='line' id='LC8482'>their base condition simply to the presence of slavery in their</div><div class='line' id='LC8483'>midst, were yet pusillanimously ready to side with the slave-lords</div><div class='line' id='LC8484'>in all political moves for the upholding and perpetuating of</div><div class='line' id='LC8485'>slavery, and did also finally shoulder their muskets and pour out</div><div class='line' id='LC8486'>their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that very</div><div class='line' id='LC8487'>institution which degraded them.  And there was only one redeeming</div><div class='line' id='LC8488'>feature connected with that pitiful piece of history; and that was,</div><div class='line' id='LC8489'>that secretly the &quot;poor white&quot; did detest the slave-lord, and did</div><div class='line' id='LC8490'>feel his own shame.  That feeling was not brought to the surface,</div><div class='line' id='LC8491'>but the fact that it was there and could have been brought out,</div><div class='line' id='LC8492'>under favoring circumstances, was something--in fact, it was enough;</div><div class='line' id='LC8493'>for it showed that a man is at bottom a man, after all, even if it</div><div class='line' id='LC8494'>doesn&#39;t show on the outside.</div><div class='line' id='LC8495'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8496'>Well, as it turned out, this charcoal burner was just the twin of</div><div class='line' id='LC8497'>the Southern &quot;poor white&quot; of the far future.  The king presently</div><div class='line' id='LC8498'>showed impatience, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8499'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8500'>&quot;An ye prattle here all the day, justice will miscarry.  Think ye</div><div class='line' id='LC8501'>the criminals will abide in their father&#39;s house?  They are fleeing,</div><div class='line' id='LC8502'>they are not waiting.  You should look to it that a party of horse</div><div class='line' id='LC8503'>be set upon their track.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8504'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8505'>The woman paled slightly, but quite perceptibly, and the man looked</div><div class='line' id='LC8506'>flustered and irresolute.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8507'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8508'>&quot;Come, friend, I will walk a little way with you, and explain which</div><div class='line' id='LC8509'>direction I think they would try to take.  If they were merely</div><div class='line' id='LC8510'>resisters of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity I would try</div><div class='line' id='LC8511'>to protect them from capture; but when men murder a person of</div><div class='line' id='LC8512'>high degree and likewise burn his house, that is another matter.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8513'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8514'>The last remark was for the king--to quiet him.  On the road</div><div class='line' id='LC8515'>the man pulled his resolution together, and began the march with</div><div class='line' id='LC8516'>a steady gait, but there was no eagerness in it.  By and by I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8517'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8518'>&quot;What relation were these men to you--cousins?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8519'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8520'>He turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8521'>stopped, trembling.</div><div class='line' id='LC8522'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8523'>&quot;Ah, my God, how know ye that?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8524'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8525'>&quot;I didn&#39;t know it; it was a chance guess.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8526'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8527'>&quot;Poor lads, they are lost.

He looked up and down the road to see that no one</div><div class='line' id='LC8547'>was coming, and then said in a cautious voice:</div><div class='line' id='LC8548'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8549'>&quot;From what land come you, brother, that you speak such perilous</div><div class='line' id='LC8550'>words, and seem not to be afraid?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8551'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8552'>&quot;They are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste,</div><div class='line' id='LC8553'>I take it.

I would be drawn asunder by wild horses first.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8556'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8557'>&quot;Well, then, let me say my say.  I have no fears of your repeating</div><div class='line' id='LC8558'>it.  I think devil&#39;s work has been done last night upon those</div><div class='line' id='LC8559'>innocent poor people.  That old baron got only what he deserved.</div><div class='line' id='LC8560'>If I had my way, all his kind should have the same luck.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8561'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8562'>Fear and depression vanished from the man&#39;s manner, and gratefulness</div><div class='line' id='LC8563'>and a brave animation took their place:</div><div class='line' id='LC8564'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8565'>&quot;Even though you be a spy, and your words a trap for my undoing,</div><div class='line' id='LC8566'>yet are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others</div><div class='line' id='LC8567'>like to them, I would go to the gallows happy, as having had one</div><div class='line' id='LC8568'>good feast at least in a starved life.  And I will say my say now,</div><div class='line' id='LC8569'>and ye may report it if ye be so minded.  I helped to hang my</div><div class='line' id='LC8570'>neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of</div><div class='line' id='LC8571'>zeal in the master&#39;s cause; the others helped for none other reason.</div><div class='line' id='LC8572'>All rejoice to-day that he is dead, but all do go about seemingly</div><div class='line' id='LC8573'>sorrowing, and shedding the hypocrite&#39;s tear, for in that lies</div><div class='line' id='LC8574'>safety.  I have said the words, I have said the words! the only</div><div class='line' id='LC8575'>ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth, and the reward of</div><div class='line' id='LC8576'>that taste is sufficient.  Lead on, an ye will, be it even to the</div><div class='line' id='LC8577'>scaffold, for I am ready.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8578'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8579'>There it was, you see.  A man is a man, at bottom.  Whole ages</div><div class='line' id='LC8580'>of abuse and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him.</div><div class='line' id='LC8581'>Whoever thinks it a mistake is himself mistaken.  Yes, there is</div><div class='line' id='LC8582'>plenty good enough material for a republic in the most degraded</div><div class='line' id='LC8583'>people that ever existed--even the Russians; plenty of manhood</div><div class='line' id='LC8584'>in them--even in the Germans--if one could but force it out of</div><div class='line' id='LC8585'>its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the</div><div class='line' id='LC8586'>mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever</div><div class='line' id='LC8587'>supported it.  We should see certain things yet, let us hope and</div><div class='line' id='LC8588'>believe.  First, a modified monarchy, till Arthur&#39;s days were done,</div><div class='line' id='LC8589'>then the destruction of the throne, nobility abolished, every</div><div class='line' id='LC8590'>member of it bound out to some useful trade, universal suffrage</div><div class='line' id='LC8591'>instituted, and the whole government placed in the hands of the</div><div class='line' id='LC8592'>men and women of the nation there to remain.  Yes, there was no</div><div class='line' id='LC8593'>occasion to give up my dream yet a while.</div><div class='line' id='LC8594'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8595'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8596'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8597'>CHAPTER XXXI</div><div class='line' id='LC8598'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8599'>MARCO</div><div class='line' id='LC8600'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8601'>We strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8602'>talked.  We must dispose of about the amount of time it ought</div><div class='line' id='LC8603'>to take to go to the little hamlet of Abblasoure and put justice</div><div class='line' id='LC8604'>on the track of those murderers and get back home again.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC8605'>meantime I had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet,</div><div class='line' id='LC8606'>never lost its novelty for me since I had been in Arthur&#39;s kingdom:</div><div class='line' id='LC8607'>the behavior--born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste--of chance</div><div class='line' id='LC8608'>passers-by toward each other.  Toward the shaven monk who trudged</div><div class='line' id='LC8609'>along with his cowl tilted back and the sweat washing down his</div><div class='line' id='LC8610'>fat jowls, the coal-burner was deeply reverent; to the gentleman</div><div class='line' id='LC8611'>he was abject; with the small farmer and the free mechanic he was</div><div class='line' id='LC8612'>cordial and gossipy; and when a slave passed by with a countenance</div><div class='line' id='LC8613'>respectfully lowered, this chap&#39;s nose was in the air--he couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC8614'>even see him.  Well, there are times when one would like to hang</div><div class='line' id='LC8615'>the whole human race and finish the farce.</div><div class='line' id='LC8616'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8617'>Presently we struck an incident.  A small mob of half-naked boys</div><div class='line' id='LC8618'>and girls came tearing out of the woods, scared and shrieking.</div><div class='line' id='LC8619'>The eldest among them were not more than twelve or fourteen years</div><div class='line' id='LC8620'>old.  They implored help, but they were so beside themselves that</div><div class='line' id='LC8621'>we couldn&#39;t make out what the matter was.  However, we plunged</div><div class='line' id='LC8622'>into the wood, they skurrying in the lead, and the trouble was</div><div class='line' id='LC8623'>quickly revealed: they had hanged a little fellow with a bark rope,</div><div class='line' id='LC8624'>and he was kicking and struggling, in the process of choking to</div><div class='line' id='LC8625'>death.  We rescued him, and fetched him around.  It was some more</div><div class='line' id='LC8626'>human nature; the admiring little folk imitating their elders;</div><div class='line' id='LC8627'>they were playing mob, and had achieved a success which promised</div><div class='line' id='LC8628'>to be a good deal more serious than they had bargained for.</div><div class='line' id='LC8629'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8630'>It was not a dull excursion for me.  I managed to put in the time</div><div class='line' id='LC8631'>very well.  I made various acquaintanceships, and in my quality</div><div class='line' id='LC8632'>of stranger was able to ask as many questions as I wanted to.</div><div class='line' id='LC8633'>A thing which naturally interested me, as a statesman, was the</div><div class='line' id='LC8634'>matter of wages.  I picked up what I could under that head during</div><div class='line' id='LC8635'>the afternoon.  A man who hasn&#39;t had much experience, and doesn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC8636'>think, is apt to measure a nation&#39;s prosperity or lack of prosperity</div><div class='line' id='LC8637'>by the mere size of the prevailing wages; if the wages be high, the</div><div class='line' id='LC8638'>nation is prosperous; if low, it isn&#39;t.  Which is an error.  It</div><div class='line' id='LC8639'>isn&#39;t what sum you get, it&#39;s how much you can buy with it, that&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC8640'>the important thing; and it&#39;s that that tells whether your wages</div><div class='line' id='LC8641'>are high in fact or only high in name.  I could remember how it</div><div class='line' id='LC8642'>was in the time of our great civil war in the nineteenth century.</div><div class='line' id='LC8643'>In the North a carpenter got three dollars a day, gold valuation;</div><div class='line' id='LC8644'>in the South he got fifty--payable in Confederate shinplasters</div><div class='line' id='LC8645'>worth a dollar a bushel.  In the North a suit of overalls cost</div><div class='line' id='LC8646'>three dollars--a day&#39;s wages; in the South it cost seventy-five</div><div class='line' id='LC8647'>--which was two days&#39; wages.  Other things were in proportion.</div><div class='line' id='LC8648'>Consequently, wages were twice as high in the North as they were</div><div class='line' id='LC8649'>in the South, because the one wage had that much more purchasing</div><div class='line' id='LC8650'>power than the other had.</div><div class='line' id='LC8651'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8652'>Yes, I made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that</div><div class='line' id='LC8653'>gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation</div><div class='line' id='LC8654'>--lots of milrays, lots of mills, lots of cents, a good many nickels,</div><div class='line' id='LC8655'>and some silver; all this among the artisans and commonalty</div><div class='line' id='LC8656'>generally; yes, and even some gold--but that was at the bank,</div><div class='line' id='LC8657'>that is to say, the goldsmith&#39;s.  I dropped in there while Marco,</div><div class='line' id='LC8658'>the son of Marco, was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter</div><div class='line' id='LC8659'>of a pound of salt, and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold</div><div class='line' id='LC8660'>piece.  They furnished it--that is, after they had chewed the piece,</div><div class='line' id='LC8661'>and rung it on the counter, and tried acid on it, and asked me</div><div class='line' id='LC8662'>where I got it, and who I was, and where I was from, and where</div><div class='line' id='LC8663'>I was going to, and when I expected to get there, and perhaps</div><div class='line' id='LC8664'>a couple of hundred more questions; and when they got aground,</div><div class='line' id='LC8665'>I went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily;</div><div class='line' id='LC8666'>told them I owned a dog, and his name was Watch, and my first wife</div><div class='line' id='LC8667'>was a Free Will Baptist, and her grandfather was a Prohibitionist,</div><div class='line' id='LC8668'>and I used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart</div><div class='line' id='LC8669'>on the inside of his upper lip, and died in the hope of a glorious</div><div class='line' id='LC8670'>resurrection, and so on, and so on, and so on, till even that</div><div class='line' id='LC8671'>hungry village questioner began to look satisfied, and also a shade</div><div class='line' id='LC8672'>put out; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength,</div><div class='line' id='LC8673'>and so he didn&#39;t give me any lip, but I noticed he took it out of</div><div class='line' id='LC8674'>his underlings, which was a perfectly natural thing to do.  Yes,</div><div class='line' id='LC8675'>they changed my twenty, but I judged it strained the bank a little,</div><div class='line' id='LC8676'>which was a thing to be expected, for it was the same as walking</div><div class='line' id='LC8677'>into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring</div><div class='line' id='LC8678'>the boss of it to change a two thousand-dollar bill for you all</div><div class='line' id='LC8679'>of a sudden.  He could do it, maybe; but at the same time he</div><div class='line' id='LC8680'>would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much</div><div class='line' id='LC8681'>money around in his pocket; which was probably this goldsmith&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC8682'>thought, too; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing</div><div class='line' id='LC8683'>after me with reverent admiration.</div><div class='line' id='LC8684'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8685'>Our new money was not only handsomely circulating, but its language</div><div class='line' id='LC8686'>was already glibly in use; that is to say, people had dropped</div><div class='line' id='LC8687'>the names of the former moneys, and spoke of things as being worth</div><div class='line' id='LC8688'>so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now.  It was very</div><div class='line' id='LC8689'>gratifying.  We were progressing, that was sure.</div><div class='line' id='LC8690'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8691'>I got to know several master mechanics, but about the most interesting</div><div class='line' id='LC8692'>fellow among them was the blacksmith, Dowley.  He was a live man</div><div class='line' id='LC8693'>and a brisk talker, and had two journeymen and three apprentices,</div><div class='line' id='LC8694'>and was doing a raging business.  In fact, he was getting rich,</div><div class='line' id='LC8695'>hand over fist, and was vastly respected.  Marco was very proud of</div><div class='line' id='LC8696'>having such a man for a friend.  He had taken me there ostensibly</div><div class='line' id='LC8697'>to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his</div><div class='line' id='LC8698'>charcoal, but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar</div><div class='line' id='LC8699'>terms he was on with this great man.  Dowley and I fraternized</div><div class='line' id='LC8700'>at once; I had had just such picked men, splendid fellows, under</div><div class='line' id='LC8701'>me in the Colt Arms Factory.  I was bound to see more of him, so</div><div class='line' id='LC8702'>I invited him to come out to Marco&#39;s Sunday, and dine with us.</div><div class='line' id='LC8703'>Marco was appalled, and held his breath; and when the grandee</div><div class='line' id='LC8704'>accepted, he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished</div><div class='line' id='LC8705'>at the condescension.</div><div class='line' id='LC8706'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8707'>Marco&#39;s joy was exuberant--but only for a moment; then he grew</div><div class='line' id='LC8708'>thoughtful, then sad; and when he heard me tell Dowley I should</div><div class='line' id='LC8709'>have Dickon, the boss mason, and Smug, the boss wheelwright, out</div><div class='line' id='LC8710'>there, too, the coal-dust on his face turned to chalk, and he lost</div><div class='line' id='LC8711'>his grip.  But I knew what was the matter with him; it was the</div><div class='line' id='LC8712'>expense.  He saw ruin before him; he judged that his financial</div><div class='line' id='LC8713'>days were numbered.  However, on our way to invite the others,</div><div class='line' id='LC8714'>I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8715'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8716'>&quot;You must allow me to have these friends come; and you must also</div><div class='line' id='LC8717'>allow me to pay the costs.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8718'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8719'>His face cleared, and he said with spirit:</div><div class='line' id='LC8720'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8721'>&quot;But not all of it, not all of it.  Ye cannot well bear a burden</div><div class='line' id='LC8722'>like to this alone.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8723'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8724'>I stopped him, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8725'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8726'>&quot;Now let&#39;s understand each other on the spot, old friend.  I am</div><div class='line' id='LC8727'>only a farm bailiff, it is true; but I am not poor, nevertheless.</div><div class='line' id='LC8728'>I have been very fortunate this year--you would be astonished</div><div class='line' id='LC8729'>to know how I have thriven.  I tell you the honest truth when I say</div><div class='line' id='LC8730'>I could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never</div><div class='line' id='LC8731'>care _that_ for the expense!&quot; and I snapped my fingers.  I could</div><div class='line' id='LC8732'>see myself rise a foot at a time in Marco&#39;s estimation, and when</div><div class='line' id='LC8733'>I fetched out those last words I was become a very tower for style</div><div class='line' id='LC8734'>and altitude.  &quot;So you see, you must let me have my way.  You</div><div class='line' id='LC8735'>can&#39;t contribute a cent to this orgy, that&#39;s _settled_.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8736'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8737'>&quot;It&#39;s grand and good of you--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8738'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8739'>&quot;No, it isn&#39;t.  You&#39;ve opened your house to Jones and me in the</div><div class='line' id='LC8740'>most generous way; Jones was remarking upon it to-day, just before</div><div class='line' id='LC8741'>you came back from the village; for although he wouldn&#39;t be likely</div><div class='line' id='LC8742'>to say such a thing to you--because Jones isn&#39;t a talker, and is</div><div class='line' id='LC8743'>diffident in society--he has a good heart and a grateful, and</div><div class='line' id='LC8744'>knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated; yes, you and</div><div class='line' id='LC8745'>your wife have been very hospitable toward us--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8746'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8747'>&quot;Ah, brother, &#39;tis nothing--_such_ hospitality!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8748'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8749'>&quot;But it _is_ something; the best a man has, freely given, is always</div><div class='line' id='LC8750'>something, and is as good as a prince can do, and ranks right</div><div class='line' id='LC8751'>along beside it--for even a prince can but do his best.  And so</div><div class='line' id='LC8752'>we&#39;ll shop around and get up this layout now, and don&#39;t you worry</div><div class='line' id='LC8753'>about the expense.  I&#39;m one of the worst spendthrifts that ever</div><div class='line' id='LC8754'>was born.  Why, do you know, sometimes in a single week I spend</div><div class='line' id='LC8755'>--but never mind about that--you&#39;d never believe it anyway.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8756'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8757'>And so we went gadding along, dropping in here and there, pricing</div><div class='line' id='LC8758'>things, and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot, and now</div><div class='line' id='LC8759'>and then running across pathetic reminders of it, in the persons of</div><div class='line' id='LC8760'>shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes</div><div class='line' id='LC8761'>had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged.</div><div class='line' id='LC8762'>The raiment of Marco and his wife was of coarse tow-linen and</div><div class='line' id='LC8763'>linsey-woolsey respectively, and resembled township maps, it being</div><div class='line' id='LC8764'>made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added, township</div><div class='line' id='LC8765'>by township, in the course of five or six years, until hardly a</div><div class='line' id='LC8766'>hand&#39;s-breadth of the original garments was surviving and present.</div><div class='line' id='LC8767'>Now I wanted to fit these people out with new suits, on account of</div><div class='line' id='LC8768'>that swell company, and I didn&#39;t know just how to get at it</div><div class='line' id='LC8769'>--with delicacy, until at last it struck me that as I had already</div><div class='line' id='LC8770'>been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king, it would</div><div class='line' id='LC8771'>be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial</div><div class='line' id='LC8772'>sort; so I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8773'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8774'>&quot;And Marco, there&#39;s another thing which you must permit--out of</div><div class='line' id='LC8775'>kindness for Jones--because you wouldn&#39;t want to offend him.</div><div class='line' id='LC8776'>He was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way, but</div><div class='line' id='LC8777'>he is so diffident he couldn&#39;t venture it himself, and so he begged</div><div class='line' id='LC8778'>me to buy some little things and give them to you and Dame Phyllis</div><div class='line' id='LC8779'>and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from</div><div class='line' id='LC8780'>him--you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing</div><div class='line' id='LC8781'>--and so I said I would, and we would keep mum.  Well, his idea</div><div class='line' id='LC8782'>was, a new outfit of clothes for you both--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8783'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8784'>&quot;Oh, it is wastefulness!  It may not be, brother, it may not be.</div><div class='line' id='LC8785'>Consider the vastness of the sum--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8786'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8787'>&quot;Hang the vastness of the sum!  Try to keep quiet for a moment,</div><div class='line' id='LC8788'>and see how it would seem; a body can&#39;t get in a word edgeways,</div><div class='line' id='LC8789'>you talk so much.  You ought to cure that, Marco; it isn&#39;t good</div><div class='line' id='LC8790'>form, you know, and it will grow on you if you don&#39;t check it.</div><div class='line' id='LC8791'>Yes, we&#39;ll step in here now and price this man&#39;s stuff--and don&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC8792'>forget to remember to not let on to Jones that you know he had</div><div class='line' id='LC8793'>anything to do with it.  You can&#39;t think how curiously sensitive</div><div class='line' id='LC8794'>and proud he is.  He&#39;s a farmer--pretty fairly well-to-do farmer</div><div class='line' id='LC8795'>--and I&#39;m his bailiff; _but_--the imagination of that man!  Why,</div><div class='line' id='LC8796'>sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off, you&#39;d</div><div class='line' id='LC8797'>think he was one of the swells of the earth; and you might listen</div><div class='line' id='LC8798'>to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer--especially if</div><div class='line' id='LC8799'>he talked agriculture.  He _thinks_ he&#39;s a Sheol of a farmer; thinks</div><div class='line' id='LC8800'>he&#39;s old Grayback from Wayback; but between you and me privately</div><div class='line' id='LC8801'>he don&#39;t know as much about farming as he does about running</div><div class='line' id='LC8802'>a kingdom--still, whatever he talks about, you want to drop your</div><div class='line' id='LC8803'>underjaw and listen, the same as if you had never heard such</div><div class='line' id='LC8804'>incredible wisdom in all your life before, and were afraid you</div><div class='line' id='LC8805'>might die before you got enough of it.  That will please Jones.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8806'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8807'>It tickled Marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character;</div><div class='line' id='LC8808'>but it also prepared him for accidents; and in my experience when</div><div class='line' id='LC8809'>you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and</div><div class='line' id='LC8810'>can&#39;t remember it more than about half the time, you can&#39;t take</div><div class='line' id='LC8811'>too many precautions.</div><div class='line' id='LC8812'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8813'>This was the best store we had come across yet; it had everything</div><div class='line' id='LC8814'>in it, in small quantities, from anvils and drygoods all the way</div><div class='line' id='LC8815'>down to fish and pinchbeck jewelry.  I concluded I would bunch</div><div class='line' id='LC8816'>my whole invoice right here, and not go pricing around any more.</div><div class='line' id='LC8817'>So I got rid of Marco, by sending him off to invite the mason and</div><div class='line' id='LC8818'>the wheelwright, which left the field free to me.  For I never care</div><div class='line' id='LC8819'>to do a thing in a quiet way; it&#39;s got to be theatrical or I don&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC8820'>take any interest in it.  I showed up money enough, in a careless</div><div class='line' id='LC8821'>way, to corral the shopkeeper&#39;s respect, and then I wrote down</div><div class='line' id='LC8822'>a list of the things I wanted, and handed it to him to see if he</div><div class='line' id='LC8823'>could read it.  He could, and was proud to show that he could.</div><div class='line' id='LC8824'>He said he had been educated by a priest, and could both read</div><div class='line' id='LC8825'>and write.  He ran it through, and remarked with satisfaction that</div><div class='line' id='LC8826'>it was a pretty heavy bill.  Well, and so it was, for a little</div><div class='line' id='LC8827'>concern like that.  I was not only providing a swell dinner, but</div><div class='line' id='LC8828'>some odds and ends of extras.  I ordered that the things be carted</div><div class='line' id='LC8829'>out and delivered at the dwelling of Marco, the son of Marco,</div><div class='line' id='LC8830'>by Saturday evening, and send me the bill at dinner-time Sunday.</div><div class='line' id='LC8831'>He said I could depend upon his promptness and exactitude, it was</div><div class='line' id='LC8832'>the rule of the house.  He also observed that he would throw in</div><div class='line' id='LC8833'>a couple of miller-guns for the Marcos gratis--that everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC8834'>was using them now.  He had a mighty opinion of that clever</div><div class='line' id='LC8835'>device.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC8836'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8837'>&quot;And please fill them up to the middle mark, too; and add that</div><div class='line' id='LC8838'>to the bill.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8839'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8840'>He would, with pleasure.  He filled them, and I took them with</div><div class='line' id='LC8841'>me.  I couldn&#39;t venture to tell him that the miller-gun was a</div><div class='line' id='LC8842'>little invention of my own, and that I had officially ordered that</div><div class='line' id='LC8843'>every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them</div><div class='line' id='LC8844'>at government price--which was the merest trifle, and the shopkeeper</div><div class='line' id='LC8845'>got that, not the government.  We furnished them for nothing.</div><div class='line' id='LC8846'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8847'>The king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC8848'>had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of Gaul</div><div class='line' id='LC8849'>with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back, and the afternoon</div><div class='line' id='LC8850'>had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again.</div><div class='line' id='LC8851'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8852'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8853'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8854'>CHAPTER XXXII</div><div class='line' id='LC8855'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8856'>DOWLEY&#39;S HUMILIATION</div><div class='line' id='LC8857'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8858'>Well, when that cargo arrived toward sunset, Saturday afternoon,</div><div class='line' id='LC8859'>I had my hands full to keep the Marcos from fainting.  They were</div><div class='line' id='LC8860'>sure Jones and I were ruined past help, and they blamed themselves</div><div class='line' id='LC8861'>as accessories to this bankruptcy.  You see, in addition to the</div><div class='line' id='LC8862'>dinner-materials, which called for a sufficiently round sum,</div><div class='line' id='LC8863'>I had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family:</div><div class='line' id='LC8864'>for instance, a big lot of wheat, a delicacy as rare to the tables</div><div class='line' id='LC8865'>of their class as was ice-cream to a hermit&#39;s; also a sizeable</div><div class='line' id='LC8866'>deal dinner-table; also two entire pounds of salt, which was</div><div class='line' id='LC8867'>another piece of extravagance in those people&#39;s eyes; also crockery,</div><div class='line' id='LC8868'>stools, the clothes, a small cask of beer, and so on.  I instructed</div><div class='line' id='LC8869'>the Marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness, so as to give</div><div class='line' id='LC8870'>me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little.  Concerning</div><div class='line' id='LC8871'>the new clothes, the simple couple were like children; they were up</div><div class='line' id='LC8872'>and down, all night, to see if it wasn&#39;t nearly daylight, so that</div><div class='line' id='LC8873'>they could put them on, and they were into them at last as much</div><div class='line' id='LC8874'>as an hour before dawn was due.  Then their pleasure--not to say</div><div class='line' id='LC8875'>delirium--was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it</div><div class='line' id='LC8876'>paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered.</div><div class='line' id='LC8877'>The king had slept just as usual--like the dead.  The Marcos could</div><div class='line' id='LC8878'>not thank him for their clothes, that being forbidden; but they</div><div class='line' id='LC8879'>tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful</div><div class='line' id='LC8880'>they were.  Which all went for nothing: he didn&#39;t notice any change.</div><div class='line' id='LC8881'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8882'>It turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is</div><div class='line' id='LC8883'>just a June day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be</div><div class='line' id='LC8884'>out of doors.  Toward noon the guests arrived, and we assembled</div><div class='line' id='LC8885'>under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances.</div><div class='line' id='LC8886'>Even the king&#39;s reserve melted a little, though it was some little</div><div class='line' id='LC8887'>trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at</div><div class='line' id='LC8888'>first.  I had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer;</div><div class='line' id='LC8889'>but I had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing</div><div class='line' id='LC8890'>stand at that, and not elaborate it any.  Because he was just the</div><div class='line' id='LC8891'>kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like</div><div class='line' id='LC8892'>that if you didn&#39;t warn him, his tongue was so handy, and his</div><div class='line' id='LC8893'>spirit so willing, and his information so uncertain.</div><div class='line' id='LC8894'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8895'>Dowley was in fine feather, and I early got him started, and then</div><div class='line' id='LC8896'>adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and</div><div class='line' id='LC8897'>himself for a hero, and then it was good to sit there and hear him</div><div class='line' id='LC8898'>hum.  Self-made man, you know.  They know how to talk.  They do</div><div class='line' id='LC8899'>deserve more credit than any other breed of men, yes, that is true;</div><div class='line' id='LC8900'>and they are among the very first to find it out, too.  He told how</div><div class='line' id='LC8901'>he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends</div><div class='line' id='LC8902'>able to help him; how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest</div><div class='line' id='LC8903'>master lived; how his day&#39;s work was from sixteen to eighteen hours</div><div class='line' id='LC8904'>long, and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a</div><div class='line' id='LC8905'>half-fed condition; how his faithful endeavors finally attracted</div><div class='line' id='LC8906'>the attention of a good blacksmith, who came near knocking him</div><div class='line' id='LC8907'>dead with kindness by suddenly offering, when he was totally</div><div class='line' id='LC8908'>unprepared, to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years</div><div class='line' id='LC8909'>and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade--or &quot;mystery&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8910'>as Dowley called it.  That was his first great rise, his first</div><div class='line' id='LC8911'>gorgeous stroke of fortune; and you saw that he couldn&#39;t yet speak</div><div class='line' id='LC8912'>of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a</div><div class='line' id='LC8913'>gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human</div><div class='line' id='LC8914'>being.  He got no new clothing during his apprenticeship, but on</div><div class='line' id='LC8915'>his graduation day his master tricked him out in spang-new tow-linens</div><div class='line' id='LC8916'>and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine.</div><div class='line' id='LC8917'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8918'>&quot;I remember me of that day!&quot; the wheelwright sang out, with</div><div class='line' id='LC8919'>enthusiasm.</div><div class='line' id='LC8920'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8921'>&quot;And I likewise!&quot; cried the mason.  &quot;I would not believe they</div><div class='line' id='LC8922'>were thine own; in faith I could not.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8923'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8924'>&quot;Nor other!&quot; shouted Dowley, with sparkling eyes.  &quot;I was like</div><div class='line' id='LC8925'>to lose my character, the neighbors wending I had mayhap been</div><div class='line' id='LC8926'>stealing.  It was a great day, a great day; one forgetteth not</div><div class='line' id='LC8927'>days like that.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8928'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8929'>Yes, and his master was a fine man, and prosperous, and always</div><div class='line' id='LC8930'>had a great feast of meat twice in the year, and with it white</div><div class='line' id='LC8931'>bread, true wheaten bread; in fact, lived like a lord, so to speak.</div><div class='line' id='LC8932'>And in time Dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter.</div><div class='line' id='LC8933'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8934'>&quot;And now consider what is come to pass,&quot; said he, impressively.</div><div class='line' id='LC8935'>&quot;Two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8936'>He made a pause here, to let that fact sink home, then added</div><div class='line' id='LC8937'>--&quot;and eight times salt meat.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8938'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8939'>&quot;It is even true,&quot; said the wheelwright, with bated breath.</div><div class='line' id='LC8940'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8941'>&quot;I know it of mine own knowledge,&quot; said the mason, in the same</div><div class='line' id='LC8942'>reverent fashion.</div><div class='line' id='LC8943'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8944'>&quot;On my table appeareth white bread every Sunday in the year,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8945'>added the master smith, with solemnity.  &quot;I leave it to your own</div><div class='line' id='LC8946'>consciences, friends, if this is not also true?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC8947'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC8948'>&quot;By my head, yes,&quot;

But Marco was in Paradise;</div><div class='line' id='LC8992'>you could see that, too.  Then the dame brought two fine new</div><div class='line' id='LC8993'>stools--whew! that was a sensation; it was visible in the eyes of</div><div class='line' id='LC8994'>every guest.  Then she brought two more--as calmly as she could.</div><div class='line' id='LC8995'>Sensation again--with awed murmurs.  Again she brought two</div><div class='line' id='LC8996'>--walking on air, she was so proud.

Yes, Dowley was a good deal wilted, and shrunk-up and</div><div class='line' id='LC9122'>collapsed; he had the aspect of a bladder-balloon that&#39;s been</div><div class='line' id='LC9123'>stepped on by a cow.</div><div class='line' id='LC9124'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9125'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9126'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9127'>CHAPTER XXXIII</div><div class='line' id='LC9128'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9129'>SIXTH CENTURY POLITICAL ECONOMY</div><div class='line' id='LC9130'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9131'>However, I made a dead set at him, and before the first third</div><div class='line' id='LC9132'>of the dinner was reached, I had him happy again.

You see, in a country</div><div class='line' id='LC9134'>where they have ranks and castes, a man isn&#39;t ever a man, he is</div><div class='line' id='LC9135'>only part of a man, he can&#39;t ever get his full growth.  You prove</div><div class='line' id='LC9136'>your superiority over him in station, or rank, or fortune, and</div><div class='line' id='LC9137'>that&#39;s the end of it--he knuckles down.  You can&#39;t insult him</div><div class='line' id='LC9138'>after that.  No, I don&#39;t mean quite that; of course you _can_ insult</div><div class='line' id='LC9139'>him, I only mean it&#39;s difficult; and so, unless you&#39;ve got a lot</div><div class='line' id='LC9140'>of useless time on your hands it doesn&#39;t pay to try.  I had the</div><div class='line' id='LC9141'>smith&#39;s reverence now, because I was apparently immensely prosperous</div><div class='line' id='LC9142'>and rich; I could have had his adoration if I had had some little</div><div class='line' id='LC9143'>gimcrack title of nobility.  And not only his, but any commoner&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC9144'>in the land, though he were the mightiest production of all the ages,</div><div class='line' id='LC9145'>in intellect, worth, and character, and I bankrupt in all three.</div><div class='line' id='LC9146'>This was to remain so, as long as England should exist in the</div><div class='line' id='LC9147'>earth.

Mrs. Marco cleared the table, placed</div><div class='line' id='LC9156'>the beer keg handy, and went away to eat her dinner of leavings</div><div class='line' id='LC9157'>in humble privacy, and the rest of us soon drifted into matters</div><div class='line' id='LC9158'>near and dear to the hearts of our sort--business and wages,</div><div class='line' id='LC9159'>of course.  At a first glance, things appeared to be exceeding</div><div class='line' id='LC9160'>prosperous in this little tributary kingdom--whose lord was</div><div class='line' id='LC9161'>King Bagdemagus--as compared with the state of things in my own</div><div class='line' id='LC9162'>region.  They had the &quot;protection&quot; system in full force here,</div><div class='line' id='LC9163'>whereas we were working along down toward free-trade, by easy</div><div class='line' id='LC9164'>stages, and were now about half way.  Before long, Dowley and I</div><div class='line' id='LC9165'>were doing all the talking, the others hungrily listening.  Dowley</div><div class='line' id='LC9166'>warmed to his work, snuffed an advantage in the air, and began</div><div class='line' id='LC9167'>to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me,</div><div class='line' id='LC9168'>and they did have something of that look:</div><div class='line' id='LC9169'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9170'>&quot;In your country, brother, what is the wage of a master bailiff,</div><div class='line' id='LC9171'>master hind, carter, shepherd, swineherd?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9172'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9173'>&quot;Twenty-five milrays a day; that is to say, a quarter of a cent.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9174'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9175'>The smith&#39;s face beamed with joy.

I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC9230'>&quot;Look here, dear friend, _what&#39;s become of your high wages you</div><div class='line' id='LC9231'>were bragging so about a few minutes ago?_&quot;--and I looked around</div><div class='line' id='LC9232'>on the company with placid satisfaction, for I had slipped up</div><div class='line' id='LC9233'>on him gradually and tied him hand and foot, you see, without his</div><div class='line' id='LC9234'>ever noticing that he was being tied at all.  &quot;What&#39;s become of</div><div class='line' id='LC9235'>those noble high wages of yours?--I seem to have knocked the</div><div class='line' id='LC9236'>stuffing all out of them, it appears to me.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9237'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9238'>But if you will believe me, he merely looked surprised, that</div><div class='line' id='LC9239'>is all! he didn&#39;t grasp the situation at all, didn&#39;t know he had</div><div class='line' id='LC9240'>walked into a trap, didn&#39;t discover that he was _in_ a trap.  I could</div><div class='line' id='LC9241'>have shot him, from sheer vexation.  With cloudy eye and a struggling</div><div class='line' id='LC9242'>intellect he fetched this out:</div><div class='line' id='LC9243'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9244'>&quot;Marry, I seem not to understand.  It is _proved_ that our wages</div><div class='line' id='LC9245'>be double thine; how then may it be that thou&#39;st knocked therefrom</div><div class='line' id='LC9246'>the stuffing?--an miscall not the wonderly word, this being the</div><div class='line' id='LC9247'>first time under grace and providence of God it hath been granted</div><div class='line' id='LC9248'>me to hear it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9249'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9250'>Well, I was stunned; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on</div><div class='line' id='LC9251'>his part, and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with</div><div class='line' id='LC9252'>him and were of his mind--if you might call it mind.  My position</div><div class='line' id='LC9253'>was simple enough, plain enough; how could it ever be simplified</div><div class='line' id='LC9254'>more?  However, I must try:</div><div class='line' id='LC9255'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9256'>&quot;Why, look here, brother Dowley, don&#39;t you see?  Your wages are</div><div class='line' id='LC9257'>merely higher than ours in _name_, not in _fact_.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9258'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9259'>&quot;Hear him!  They are the _double_--ye have confessed it yourself.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9260'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9261'>&quot;Yes-yes, I don&#39;t deny that at all.  But that&#39;s got nothing to do</div><div class='line' id='LC9262'>with it; the _amount_ of the wages in mere coins, with meaningless</div><div class='line' id='LC9263'>names attached to them to know them by, has got nothing to do</div><div class='line' id='LC9264'>with it.  The thing is, how much can you _buy_ with your wages?</div><div class='line' id='LC9265'>--that&#39;s the idea.  While it is true that with you a good mechanic</div><div class='line' id='LC9266'>is allowed about three dollars and a half a year, and with us only</div><div class='line' id='LC9267'>about a dollar and seventy-five--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9268'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9269'>&quot;There--ye&#39;re confessing it again, ye&#39;re confessing it again!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9270'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9271'>&quot;Confound it, I&#39;ve never denied it, I tell you!  What I say is</div><div class='line' id='LC9272'>this.  With us _half_ a dollar buys more than a _dollar_ buys</div><div class='line' id='LC9273'>with you--and THEREFORE it stands to reason and the commonest</div><div class='line' id='LC9274'>kind of common-sense, that our wages are _higher_ than yours.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9275'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9276'>He looked dazed, and said, despairingly:</div><div class='line' id='LC9277'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9278'>&quot;Verily, I cannot make it out.  Ye&#39;ve just said ours are the</div><div class='line' id='LC9279'>higher, and with the same breath ye take it back.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9280'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9281'>&quot;Oh, great Scott, isn&#39;t it possible to get such a simple thing</div><div class='line' id='LC9282'>through your head?  Now look here--let me illustrate.  We pay</div><div class='line' id='LC9283'>four cents for a woman&#39;s stuff gown, you pay 8.4.0, which is</div><div class='line' id='LC9284'>four mills more than _double_.  What do you allow a laboring</div><div class='line' id='LC9285'>woman who works on a farm?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9286'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9287'>&quot;Two mills a day.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9288'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9289'>&quot;Very good; we allow but half as much; we pay her only a tenth</div><div class='line' id='LC9290'>of a cent a day; and--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9291'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9292'>&quot;Again ye&#39;re conf--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9293'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9294'>&quot;Wait!  Now, you see, the thing is very simple; this time you&#39;ll</div><div class='line' id='LC9295'>understand it.  For instance, it takes your woman 42 days to earn</div><div class='line' id='LC9296'>her gown, at 2 mills a day--7 weeks&#39; work; but ours earns hers</div><div class='line' id='LC9297'>in forty days--two days _short_ of 7 weeks.  Your woman has a gown,</div><div class='line' id='LC9298'>and her whole seven weeks wages are gone; ours has a gown, and</div><div class='line' id='LC9299'>two days&#39; wages left, to buy something else with.  There--_now_</div><div class='line' id='LC9300'>you understand it!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9301'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9302'>He looked--well, he merely looked dubious, it&#39;s the most I can say;</div><div class='line' id='LC9303'>so did the others.  I waited--to let the thing work.  Dowley spoke</div><div class='line' id='LC9304'>at last--and betrayed the fact that he actually hadn&#39;t gotten away</div><div class='line' id='LC9305'>from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet.  He said, with</div><div class='line' id='LC9306'>a trifle of hesitancy:</div><div class='line' id='LC9307'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9308'>&quot;But--but--ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better</div><div class='line' id='LC9309'>than one.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9310'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9311'>Shucks!  Well, of course, I hated to give it up.  So I chanced</div><div class='line' id='LC9312'>another flyer:</div><div class='line' id='LC9313'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9314'>&quot;Let us suppose a case.  Suppose one of your journeymen goes out</div><div class='line' id='LC9315'>and buys the following articles:</div><div class='line' id='LC9316'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9317'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;1 pound of salt;</div><div class='line' id='LC9318'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 dozen eggs;</div><div class='line' id='LC9319'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 dozen pints of beer;</div><div class='line' id='LC9320'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 bushel of wheat;</div><div class='line' id='LC9321'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 tow-linen suit;</div><div class='line' id='LC9322'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 pounds of beef;</div><div class='line' id='LC9323'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 pounds of mutton.</div><div class='line' id='LC9324'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9325'>&quot;The lot will cost him 32 cents.  It takes him 32 working days</div><div class='line' id='LC9326'>to earn the money--5 weeks and 2 days.  Let him come to us and</div><div class='line' id='LC9327'>work 32 days at _half_ the wages; he can buy all those things for</div><div class='line' id='LC9328'>a shade under 14 1/2 cents; they will cost him a shade under 29</div><div class='line' id='LC9329'>days&#39; work, and he will have about half a week&#39;s wages over.  Carry</div><div class='line' id='LC9330'>it through the year; he would save nearly a week&#39;s wages every</div><div class='line' id='LC9331'>two months, _your_ man nothing; thus saving five or six weeks&#39; wages</div><div class='line' id='LC9332'>in a year, your man not a cent.  _Now_ I reckon you understand that</div><div class='line' id='LC9333'>&#39;high wages&#39; and &#39;low wages&#39; are phrases that don&#39;t mean anything</div><div class='line' id='LC9334'>in the world until you find out which of them will _buy_ the most!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9335'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9336'>It was a crusher.</div><div class='line' id='LC9337'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9338'>But, alas! it didn&#39;t crush.  No, I had to give it up.  What those</div><div class='line' id='LC9339'>people valued was _high wages_; it didn&#39;t seem to be a matter of</div><div class='line' id='LC9340'>any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything</div><div class='line' id='LC9341'>or not.  They stood for &quot;protection,&quot; and swore by it, which was</div><div class='line' id='LC9342'>reasonable enough, because interested parties had gulled them into</div><div class='line' id='LC9343'>the notion that it was protection which had created their high</div><div class='line' id='LC9344'>wages.  I proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages</div><div class='line' id='LC9345'>had advanced but 30 per cent., while the cost of living had gone</div><div class='line' id='LC9346'>up 100; and that with us, in a shorter time, wages had advanced</div><div class='line' id='LC9347'>40 per cent. while the cost of living had gone steadily down.  But</div><div class='line' id='LC9348'>it didn&#39;t do any good.  Nothing could unseat their strange beliefs.</div><div class='line' id='LC9349'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9350'>Well, I was smarting under a sense of defeat.  Undeserved defeat,</div><div class='line' id='LC9351'>but what of that?  That didn&#39;t soften the smart any.  And to think</div><div class='line' id='LC9352'>of the circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest</div><div class='line' id='LC9353'>man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest</div><div class='line' id='LC9354'>uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political</div><div class='line' id='LC9355'>firmament for centuries, sitting here apparently defeated in</div><div class='line' id='LC9356'>argument by an ignorant country blacksmith!  And I could see that</div><div class='line' id='LC9357'>those others were sorry for me--which made me blush till I could</div><div class='line' id='LC9358'>smell my whiskers scorching.  Put yourself in my place; feel as mean</div><div class='line' id='LC9359'>as I did, as ashamed as I felt--wouldn&#39;t _you_ have struck below the</div><div class='line' id='LC9360'>belt to get even?  Yes, you would; it is simply human nature.</div><div class='line' id='LC9361'>Well, that is what I did.  I am not trying to justify it; I&#39;m only</div><div class='line' id='LC9362'>saying that I was mad, and _anybody_ would have done it.</div><div class='line' id='LC9363'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9364'>Well, when I make up my mind to hit a man, I don&#39;t plan out</div><div class='line' id='LC9365'>a love-tap; no, that isn&#39;t my way; as long as I&#39;m going to hit him</div><div class='line' id='LC9366'>at all, I&#39;m going to hit him a lifter.  And I don&#39;t jump at him</div><div class='line' id='LC9367'>all of a sudden, and risk making a blundering half-way business</div><div class='line' id='LC9368'>of it; no, I get away off yonder to one side, and work up on him</div><div class='line' id='LC9369'>gradually, so that he never suspects that I&#39;m going to hit him</div><div class='line' id='LC9370'>at all; and by and by, all in a flash, he&#39;s flat on his back, and</div><div class='line' id='LC9371'>he can&#39;t tell for the life of him how it all happened.  That is</div><div class='line' id='LC9372'>the way I went for brother Dowley.  I started to talking lazy and</div><div class='line' id='LC9373'>comfortable, as if I was just talking to pass the time; and the</div><div class='line' id='LC9374'>oldest man in the world couldn&#39;t have taken the bearings of my</div><div class='line' id='LC9375'>starting place and guessed where I was going to fetch up:</div><div class='line' id='LC9376'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9377'>&quot;Boys, there&#39;s a good many curious things about law, and custom,</div><div class='line' id='LC9378'>and usage, and all that sort of thing, when you come to look at it;</div><div class='line' id='LC9379'>yes, and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement,</div><div class='line' id='LC9380'>too.  There are written laws--they perish; but there are also</div><div class='line' id='LC9381'>unwritten laws--_they_ are eternal.  Take the unwritten law of wages:</div><div class='line' id='LC9382'>it says they&#39;ve got to advance, little by little, straight through</div><div class='line' id='LC9383'>the centuries.  And notice how it works.  We know what wages are</div><div class='line' id='LC9384'>now, here and there and yonder; we strike an average, and say that&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC9385'>the wages of to-day.  We know what the wages were a hundred years</div><div class='line' id='LC9386'>ago, and what they were two hundred years ago; that&#39;s as far back</div><div class='line' id='LC9387'>as we can get, but it suffices to give us the law of progress,</div><div class='line' id='LC9388'>the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation; and so, without</div><div class='line' id='LC9389'>a document to help us, we can come pretty close to determining</div><div class='line' id='LC9390'>what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago.</div><div class='line' id='LC9391'>Good, so far.  Do we stop there?  No.  We stop looking backward;</div><div class='line' id='LC9392'>we face around and apply the law to the future.  My friends, I can</div><div class='line' id='LC9393'>tell you what people&#39;s wages are going to be at any date in the</div><div class='line' id='LC9394'>future you want to know, for hundreds and hundreds of years.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9395'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9396'>&quot;What, goodman, what!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9397'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9398'>&quot;Yes.  In seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times</div><div class='line' id='LC9399'>what they are now, here in your region, and farm hands will be</div><div class='line' id='LC9400'>allowed 3 cents a day, and mechanics 6.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9401'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9402'>&quot;I would&#39;t I might die now and live then!&quot; interrupted Smug, the</div><div class='line' id='LC9403'>wheelwright, with a fine avaricious glow in his eye.</div><div class='line' id='LC9404'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9405'>&quot;And that isn&#39;t all; they&#39;ll get their board besides--such as it is:</div><div class='line' id='LC9406'>it won&#39;t bloat them.  Two hundred and fifty years later--pay attention</div><div class='line' id='LC9407'>now--a mechanic&#39;s wages will be--mind you, this is law, not</div><div class='line' id='LC9408'>guesswork; a mechanic&#39;s wages will then be _twenty_ cents a day!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9409'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9410'>There was a general gasp of awed astonishment, Dickon the mason</div><div class='line' id='LC9411'>murmured, with raised eyes and hands:</div><div class='line' id='LC9412'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9413'>&quot;More than three weeks&#39; pay for one day&#39;s work!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9414'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9415'>&quot;Riches!--of a truth, yes, riches!&quot; muttered Marco, his breath</div><div class='line' id='LC9416'>coming quick and short, with excitement.</div><div class='line' id='LC9417'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9418'>&quot;Wages will keep on rising, little by little, little by little,</div><div class='line' id='LC9419'>as steadily as a tree grows, and at the end of three hundred and</div><div class='line' id='LC9420'>forty years more there&#39;ll be at least _one_ country where the</div><div class='line' id='LC9421'>mechanic&#39;s average wage will be _two hundred_ cents a day!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9422'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9423'>It knocked them absolutely dumb!  Not a man of them could get</div><div class='line' id='LC9424'>his breath for upwards of two minutes.  Then the coal-burner</div><div class='line' id='LC9425'>said prayerfully:</div><div class='line' id='LC9426'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9427'>&quot;Might I but live to see it!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9428'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9429'>&quot;It is the income of an earl!&quot; said Smug.</div><div class='line' id='LC9430'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9431'>&quot;An earl, say ye?&quot; said Dowley; &quot;ye could say more than that and</div><div class='line' id='LC9432'>speak no lie; there&#39;s no earl in the realm of Bagdemagus that hath</div><div class='line' id='LC9433'>an income like to that.  Income of an earl--mf! it&#39;s the income</div><div class='line' id='LC9434'>of an angel!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9435'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9436'>&quot;Now, then, that is what is going to happen as regards wages.</div><div class='line' id='LC9437'>In that remote day, that man will earn, with _one_ week&#39;s work,</div><div class='line' id='LC9438'>that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of _fifty_ weeks to</div><div class='line' id='LC9439'>earn now.  Some other pretty surprising things are going to happen,</div><div class='line' id='LC9440'>too.  Brother Dowley, who is it that determines, every spring,</div><div class='line' id='LC9441'>what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic, laborer, and</div><div class='line' id='LC9442'>servant shall be for that year?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9443'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9444'>&quot;Sometimes the courts, sometimes the town council; but most of all,</div><div class='line' id='LC9445'>the magistrate.  Ye may say, in general terms, it is the magistrate</div><div class='line' id='LC9446'>that fixes the wages.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9447'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9448'>&quot;Doesn&#39;t ask any of those poor devils to _help_ him fix their wages</div><div class='line' id='LC9449'>for them, does he?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9450'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9451'>&quot;Hm!  That _were_ an idea!  The master that&#39;s to pay him the money</div><div class='line' id='LC9452'>is the one that&#39;s rightly concerned in that matter, ye will notice.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9453'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9454'>&quot;Yes--but I thought the other man might have some little trifle</div><div class='line' id='LC9455'>at stake in it, too; and even his wife and children, poor creatures.</div><div class='line' id='LC9456'>The masters are these: nobles, rich men, the prosperous generally.</div><div class='line' id='LC9457'>These few, who do no work, determine what pay the vast hive shall</div><div class='line' id='LC9458'>have who _do_ work.  You see?  They&#39;re a &#39;combine&#39;--a trade union,</div><div class='line' id='LC9459'>to coin a new phrase--who band themselves together to force their</div><div class='line' id='LC9460'>lowly brother to take what they choose to give.  Thirteen hundred</div><div class='line' id='LC9461'>years hence--so says the unwritten law--the &#39;combine&#39; will be the</div><div class='line' id='LC9462'>other way, and then how these fine people&#39;s posterity will fume</div><div class='line' id='LC9463'>and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade</div><div class='line' id='LC9464'>unions!  Yes, indeed! the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the</div><div class='line' id='LC9465'>wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century; and</div><div class='line' id='LC9466'>then all of a sudden the wage-earner will consider that a couple</div><div class='line' id='LC9467'>of thousand years or so is enough of this one-sided sort of thing;</div><div class='line' id='LC9468'>and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself.</div><div class='line' id='LC9469'>Ah, he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation</div><div class='line' id='LC9470'>to settle.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9471'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9472'>&quot;Do ye believe--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9473'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9474'>&quot;That he actually will help to fix his own wages?

In that day a man will be his own property,</div><div class='line' id='LC9492'>not the property of magistrate and master.  And he can leave town</div><div class='line' id='LC9493'>whenever he wants to, if the wages don&#39;t suit him!--and they can&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC9494'>put him in the pillory for it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9495'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9496'>&quot;Perdition catch such an age!&quot; shouted Dowley, in strong indignation.</div><div class='line' id='LC9497'>&quot;An age of dogs, an age barren of reverence for superiors and</div><div class='line' id='LC9498'>respect for authority!

Why?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9504'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9505'>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll tell you why.  Is a man ever put in the pillory for</div><div class='line' id='LC9506'>a capital crime?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9507'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9508'>&quot;No.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9509'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9510'>&quot;Is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small</div><div class='line' id='LC9511'>offense and then kill him?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9512'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9513'>There was no answer.

I think the pillory ought to be abolished.  What</div><div class='line' id='LC9520'>usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some</div><div class='line' id='LC9521'>little offense that didn&#39;t amount to anything in the world?

One may not deny it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9553'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9554'>&quot;I take it none of _you_ are unpopular--by reason of pride or</div><div class='line' id='LC9555'>insolence, or conspicuous prosperity, or any of those things that</div><div class='line' id='LC9556'>excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village?  _You_</div><div class='line' id='LC9557'>wouldn&#39;t think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9558'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9559'>Dowley winced, visibly.  I judged he was hit.  But he didn&#39;t betray</div><div class='line' id='LC9560'>it by any spoken word.  As for the others, they spoke out plainly,</div><div class='line' id='LC9561'>and with strong feeling.  They said they had seen enough of the</div><div class='line' id='LC9562'>stocks to know what a man&#39;s chance in them was, and they would</div><div class='line' id='LC9563'>never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick</div><div class='line' id='LC9564'>death by hanging.</div><div class='line' id='LC9565'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9566'>&quot;Well, to change the subject--for I think I&#39;ve established my</div><div class='line' id='LC9567'>point that the stocks ought to be abolished.  I think some of our</div><div class='line' id='LC9568'>laws are pretty unfair.  For instance, if I do a thing which ought</div><div class='line' id='LC9569'>to deliver me to the stocks, and you know I did it and yet keep</div><div class='line' id='LC9570'>still and don&#39;t report me, _you_ will get the stocks if anybody</div><div class='line' id='LC9571'>informs on you.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9572'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9573'>&quot;Ah, but that would serve you but right,&quot; said Dowley, &quot;for you</div><div class='line' id='LC9574'>_must_ inform.  So saith the law.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9575'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9576'>The others coincided.</div><div class='line' id='LC9577'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9578'>&quot;Well, all right, let it go, since you vote me down.  But there&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC9579'>one thing which certainly isn&#39;t fair.  The magistrate fixes a</div><div class='line' id='LC9580'>mechanic&#39;s wage at one cent a day, for instance.  The law says that</div><div class='line' id='LC9581'>if any master shall venture, even under utmost press of business,</div><div class='line' id='LC9582'>to pay anything _over_ that cent a day, even for a single day, he</div><div class='line' id='LC9583'>shall be both fined and pilloried for it; and whoever knows he did</div><div class='line' id='LC9584'>it and doesn&#39;t inform, they also shall be fined and pilloried.  Now</div><div class='line' id='LC9585'>it seems to me unfair, Dowley, and a deadly peril to all of us,</div><div class='line' id='LC9586'>that because you thoughtlessly confessed, a while ago, that within</div><div class='line' id='LC9587'>a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9588'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9589'>Oh, I tell _you_ it was a smasher!  You ought to have seen them to</div><div class='line' id='LC9590'>go to pieces, the whole gang.  I had just slipped up on poor</div><div class='line' id='LC9591'>smiling and complacent Dowley so nice and easy and softly, that</div><div class='line' id='LC9592'>he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow</div><div class='line' id='LC9593'>came crashing down and knocked him all to rags.</div><div class='line' id='LC9594'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9595'>A fine effect.  In fact, as fine as any I ever produced, with so</div><div class='line' id='LC9596'>little time to work it up in.</div><div class='line' id='LC9597'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9598'>But I saw in a moment that I had overdone the thing a little.</div><div class='line' id='LC9599'>I was expecting to scare them, but I wasn&#39;t expecting to scare</div><div class='line' id='LC9600'>them to death.  They were mighty near it, though.  You see they</div><div class='line' id='LC9601'>had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory; and</div><div class='line' id='LC9602'>to have that thing staring them in the face, and every one of them</div><div class='line' id='LC9603'>distinctly at the mercy of me, a stranger, if I chose to go and</div><div class='line' id='LC9604'>report--well, it was awful, and they couldn&#39;t seem to recover</div><div class='line' id='LC9605'>from the shock, they couldn&#39;t seem to pull themselves together.</div><div class='line' id='LC9606'>Pale, shaky, dumb, pitiful?  Why, they weren&#39;t any better than</div><div class='line' id='LC9607'>so many dead men.  It was very uncomfortable.  Of course, I thought</div><div class='line' id='LC9608'>they would appeal to me to keep mum, and then we would shake hands,</div><div class='line' id='LC9609'>and take a drink all round, and laugh it off, and there an end.</div><div class='line' id='LC9610'>But no; you see I was an unknown person, among a cruelly oppressed</div><div class='line' id='LC9611'>and suspicious people, a people always accustomed to having advantage</div><div class='line' id='LC9612'>taken of their helplessness, and never expecting just or kind</div><div class='line' id='LC9613'>treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates.</div><div class='line' id='LC9614'>Appeal to _me_ to be gentle, to be fair, to be generous?  Of course,</div><div class='line' id='LC9615'>they wanted to, but they couldn&#39;t dare.</div><div class='line' id='LC9616'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9617'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9618'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9619'>CHAPTER XXXIV</div><div class='line' id='LC9620'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9621'>THE YANKEE AND THE KING SOLD AS SLAVES</div><div class='line' id='LC9622'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9623'>Well, what had I better do?  Nothing in a hurry, sure.  I must</div><div class='line' id='LC9624'>get up a diversion; anything to employ me while I could think,</div><div class='line' id='LC9625'>and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life</div><div class='line' id='LC9626'>again.  There sat Marco, petrified in the act of trying to get</div><div class='line' id='LC9627'>the hang of his miller-gun--turned to stone, just in the attitude</div><div class='line' id='LC9628'>he was in when my pile-driver fell, the toy still gripped in his</div><div class='line' id='LC9629'>unconscious fingers.  So I took it from him and proposed to explain</div><div class='line' id='LC9630'>its mystery.  Mystery! a simple little thing like that; and yet it</div><div class='line' id='LC9631'>was mysterious enough, for that race and that age.</div><div class='line' id='LC9632'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9633'>I never saw such an awkward people, with machinery; you see, they</div><div class='line' id='LC9634'>were totally unused to it.  The miller-gun was a little double-barreled</div><div class='line' id='LC9635'>tube of toughened glass, with a neat little trick of a spring</div><div class='line' id='LC9636'>to it, which upon pressure would let a shot escape.  But the shot</div><div class='line' id='LC9637'>wouldn&#39;t hurt anybody, it would only drop into your hand.  In the</div><div class='line' id='LC9638'>gun were two sizes--wee mustard-seed shot, and another sort that</div><div class='line' id='LC9639'>were several times larger.  They were money.  The mustard-seed</div><div class='line' id='LC9640'>shot represented milrays, the larger ones mills.  So the gun was</div><div class='line' id='LC9641'>a purse; and very handy, too; you could pay out money in the dark</div><div class='line' id='LC9642'>with it, with accuracy; and you could carry it in your mouth; or</div><div class='line' id='LC9643'>in your vest pocket, if you had one.  I made them of several sizes</div><div class='line' id='LC9644'>--one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar.</div><div class='line' id='LC9645'>Using shot for money was a good thing for the government; the metal</div><div class='line' id='LC9646'>cost nothing, and the money couldn&#39;t be counterfeited, for I was</div><div class='line' id='LC9647'>the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower.</div><div class='line' id='LC9648'>&quot;Paying the shot&quot; soon came to be a common phrase.  Yes, and I knew</div><div class='line' id='LC9649'>it would still be passing men&#39;s lips, away down in the nineteenth</div><div class='line' id='LC9650'>century, yet none would suspect how and when it originated.</div><div class='line' id='LC9651'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9652'>The king joined us, about this time, mightily refreshed by his nap,</div><div class='line' id='LC9653'>and feeling good.  Anything could make me nervous now, I was so</div><div class='line' id='LC9654'>uneasy--for our lives were in danger; and so it worried me to</div><div class='line' id='LC9655'>detect a complacent something in the king&#39;s eye which seemed to</div><div class='line' id='LC9656'>indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance</div><div class='line' id='LC9657'>of some kind or other; confound it, why must he go and choose</div><div class='line' id='LC9658'>such a time as this?</div><div class='line' id='LC9659'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9660'>I was right.  He began, straight off, in the most innocently</div><div class='line' id='LC9661'>artful, and transparent, and lubberly way, to lead up to the</div><div class='line' id='LC9662'>subject of agriculture.  The cold sweat broke out all over me.</div><div class='line' id='LC9663'>I wanted to whisper in his ear, &quot;Man, we are in awful danger!</div><div class='line' id='LC9664'>every moment is worth a principality till we get back these men&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC9665'>confidence; _don&#39;t_ waste any of this golden time.&quot;  But of course</div><div class='line' id='LC9666'>I couldn&#39;t do it.  Whisper to him?  It would look as if we were</div><div class='line' id='LC9667'>conspiring.  So I had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while</div><div class='line' id='LC9668'>the king stood over that dynamite mine and mooned along about his</div><div class='line' id='LC9669'>damned onions and things.  At first the tumult of my own thoughts,</div><div class='line' id='LC9670'>summoned by the danger-signal and swarming to the rescue from</div><div class='line' id='LC9671'>every quarter of my skull, kept up such a hurrah and confusion</div><div class='line' id='LC9672'>and fifing and drumming that I couldn&#39;t take in a word; but</div><div class='line' id='LC9673'>presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystallize</div><div class='line' id='LC9674'>and fall into position and form line of battle, a sort of order and</div><div class='line' id='LC9675'>quiet ensued and I caught the boom of the king&#39;s batteries, as if</div><div class='line' id='LC9676'>out of remote distance:</div><div class='line' id='LC9677'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9678'>&quot;--were not the best way, methinks, albeit it is not to be denied</div><div class='line' id='LC9679'>that authorities differ as concerning this point, some contending</div><div class='line' id='LC9680'>that the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early</div><div class='line' id='LC9681'>from the tree--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9682'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9683'>The audience showed signs of life, and sought each other&#39;s eyes</div><div class='line' id='LC9684'>in a surprised and troubled way.</div><div class='line' id='LC9685'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9686'>&quot;--whileas others do yet maintain, with much show of reason, that</div><div class='line' id='LC9687'>this is not of necessity the case, instancing that plums and other</div><div class='line' id='LC9688'>like cereals do be always dug in the unripe state--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9689'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9690'>The audience exhibited distinct distress; yes, and also fear.</div><div class='line' id='LC9691'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9692'>&quot;--yet are they clearly wholesome, the more especially when one</div><div class='line' id='LC9693'>doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the</div><div class='line' id='LC9694'>tranquilizing juice of the wayward cabbage--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9695'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9696'>The wild light of terror began to glow in these men&#39;s eyes, and</div><div class='line' id='LC9697'>one of them muttered, &quot;These be errors, every one--God hath surely</div><div class='line' id='LC9698'>smitten the mind of this farmer.&quot;  I was in miserable apprehension;</div><div class='line' id='LC9699'>I sat upon thorns.</div><div class='line' id='LC9700'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9701'>&quot;--and further instancing the known truth that in the case of</div><div class='line' id='LC9702'>animals, the young, which may be called the green fruit of the</div><div class='line' id='LC9703'>creature, is the better, all confessing that when a goat is ripe,</div><div class='line' id='LC9704'>his fur doth heat and sore engame his flesh, the which defect,</div><div class='line' id='LC9705'>taken in connection with his several rancid habits, and fulsome</div><div class='line' id='LC9706'>appetites, and godless attitudes of mind, and bilious quality</div><div class='line' id='LC9707'>of morals--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9708'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9709'>They rose and went for him!  With a fierce shout, &quot;The one would</div><div class='line' id='LC9710'>betray us, the other is mad!  Kill them!  Kill them!&quot; they flung</div><div class='line' id='LC9711'>themselves upon us.  What joy flamed up in the king&#39;s eye!  He</div><div class='line' id='LC9712'>might be lame in agriculture, but this kind of thing was just in</div><div class='line' id='LC9713'>his line.  He had been fasting long, he was hungry for a fight.</div><div class='line' id='LC9714'>He hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear</div><div class='line' id='LC9715'>off his feet and stretched him flat on his back.  &quot;St. George for</div><div class='line' id='LC9716'>Britain!&quot; and he downed the wheelwright.  The mason was big, but</div><div class='line' id='LC9717'>I laid him out like nothing.  The three gathered themselves up and</div><div class='line' id='LC9718'>came again; went down again; came again; and kept on repeating</div><div class='line' id='LC9719'>this, with native British pluck, until they were battered to jelly,</div><div class='line' id='LC9720'>reeling with exhaustion, and so blind that they couldn&#39;t tell us</div><div class='line' id='LC9721'>from each other; and yet they kept right on, hammering away with</div><div class='line' id='LC9722'>what might was left in them.  Hammering each other--for we stepped</div><div class='line' id='LC9723'>aside and looked on while they rolled, and struggled, and gouged,</div><div class='line' id='LC9724'>and pounded, and bit, with the strict and wordless attention to</div><div class='line' id='LC9725'>business of so many bulldogs.  We looked on without apprehension,</div><div class='line' id='LC9726'>for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us,</div><div class='line' id='LC9727'>and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe</div><div class='line' id='LC9728'>from intrusion.</div><div class='line' id='LC9729'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9730'>Well, while they were gradually playing out, it suddenly occurred</div><div class='line' id='LC9731'>to me to wonder what had become of Marco.  I looked around; he</div><div class='line' id='LC9732'>was nowhere to be seen.  Oh, but this was ominous!  I pulled the</div><div class='line' id='LC9733'>king&#39;s sleeve, and we glided away and rushed for the hut.  No Marco</div><div class='line' id='LC9734'>there, no Phyllis there!  They had gone to the road for help, sure.</div><div class='line' id='LC9735'>I told the king to give his heels wings, and I would explain later.</div><div class='line' id='LC9736'>We made good time across the open ground, and as we darted into</div><div class='line' id='LC9737'>the shelter of the wood I glanced back and saw a mob of excited</div><div class='line' id='LC9738'>peasants swarm into view, with Marco and his wife at their head.</div><div class='line' id='LC9739'>They were making a world of noise, but that couldn&#39;t hurt anybody;</div><div class='line' id='LC9740'>the wood was dense, and as soon as we were well into its depths</div><div class='line' id='LC9741'>we would take to a tree and let them whistle.  Ah, but then came</div><div class='line' id='LC9742'>another sound--dogs!  Yes, that was quite another matter.  It</div><div class='line' id='LC9743'>magnified our contract--we must find running water.</div><div class='line' id='LC9744'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9745'>We tore along at a good gait, and soon left the sounds far behind</div><div class='line' id='LC9746'>and modified to a murmur.  We struck a stream and darted into it.</div><div class='line' id='LC9747'>We waded swiftly down it, in the dim forest light, for as much</div><div class='line' id='LC9748'>as three hundred yards, and then came across an oak with a great</div><div class='line' id='LC9749'>bough sticking out over the water.  We climbed up on this bough,</div><div class='line' id='LC9750'>and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree; now</div><div class='line' id='LC9751'>we began to hear those sounds more plainly; so the mob had struck</div><div class='line' id='LC9752'>our trail.  For a while the sounds approached pretty fast.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC9753'>then for another while they didn&#39;t.  No doubt the dogs had found</div><div class='line' id='LC9754'>the place where we had entered the stream, and were now waltzing</div><div class='line' id='LC9755'>up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again.</div><div class='line' id='LC9756'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9757'>When we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage,</div><div class='line' id='LC9758'>the king was satisfied, but I was doubtful.  I believed we could</div><div class='line' id='LC9759'>crawl along a branch and get into the next tree, and I judged it</div><div class='line' id='LC9760'>worth while to try.  We tried it, and made a success of it, though</div><div class='line' id='LC9761'>the king slipped, at the junction, and came near failing to connect.</div><div class='line' id='LC9762'>We got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among</div><div class='line' id='LC9763'>the foliage, and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt.</div><div class='line' id='LC9764'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9765'>Presently we heard it coming--and coming on the jump, too; yes,</div><div class='line' id='LC9766'>and down both sides of the stream.  Louder--louder--next minute</div><div class='line' id='LC9767'>it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings, barkings, tramplings,</div><div class='line' id='LC9768'>and swept by like a cyclone.</div><div class='line' id='LC9769'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9770'>&quot;I was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something</div><div class='line' id='LC9771'>to them,&quot; said I, &quot;but I don&#39;t mind the disappointment.  Come,</div><div class='line' id='LC9772'>my liege, it were well that we make good use of our time.  We&#39;ve</div><div class='line' id='LC9773'>flanked them.  Dark is coming on, presently.  If we can cross the</div><div class='line' id='LC9774'>stream and get a good start, and borrow a couple of horses from</div><div class='line' id='LC9775'>somebody&#39;s pasture to use for a few hours, we shall be safe enough.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9776'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9777'>We started down, and got nearly to the lowest limb, when we seemed</div><div class='line' id='LC9778'>to hear the hunt returning.  We stopped to listen.</div><div class='line' id='LC9779'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9780'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said I, &quot;they&#39;re baffled, they&#39;ve given it up, they&#39;re on</div><div class='line' id='LC9781'>their way home.  We will climb back to our roost again, and let</div><div class='line' id='LC9782'>them go by.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9783'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9784'>So we climbed back.  The king listened a moment and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC9785'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9786'>&quot;They still search--I wit the sign.  We did best to abide.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9787'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9788'>He was right.  He knew more about hunting than I did.  The noise</div><div class='line' id='LC9789'>approached steadily, but not with a rush.  The king said:</div><div class='line' id='LC9790'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9791'>&quot;They reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them,</div><div class='line' id='LC9792'>and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took</div><div class='line' id='LC9793'>the water.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9794'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9795'>&quot;Yes, sire, that is about it, I am afraid, though I was hoping</div><div class='line' id='LC9796'>better things.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9797'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9798'>The noise drew nearer and nearer, and soon the van was drifting</div><div class='line' id='LC9799'>under us, on both sides of the water.  A voice called a halt from</div><div class='line' id='LC9800'>the other bank, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC9801'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9802'>&quot;An they were so minded, they could get to yon tree by this branch</div><div class='line' id='LC9803'>that overhangs, and yet not touch ground.  Ye will do well to send</div><div class='line' id='LC9804'>a man up it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9805'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9806'>&quot;Marry, that we will do!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9807'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9808'>I was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing</div><div class='line' id='LC9809'>and swapping trees to beat it.  But, don&#39;t you know, there are</div><div class='line' id='LC9810'>some things that can beat smartness and foresight?  Awkwardness</div><div class='line' id='LC9811'>and stupidity can.  The best swordsman in the world doesn&#39;t need</div><div class='line' id='LC9812'>to fear the second best swordsman in the world; no, the person</div><div class='line' id='LC9813'>for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never</div><div class='line' id='LC9814'>had a sword in his hand before; he doesn&#39;t do the thing he ought</div><div class='line' id='LC9815'>to do, and so the expert isn&#39;t prepared for him; he does the thing</div><div class='line' id='LC9816'>he ought not to do; and often it catches the expert out and ends</div><div class='line' id='LC9817'>him on the spot.  Well, how could I, with all my gifts, make any</div><div class='line' id='LC9818'>valuable preparation against a near-sighted, cross-eyed, pudding-headed</div><div class='line' id='LC9819'>clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right</div><div class='line' id='LC9820'>one?  And that is what he did.  He went for the wrong tree, which</div><div class='line' id='LC9821'>was, of course, the right one by mistake, and up he started.</div><div class='line' id='LC9822'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9823'>Matters were serious now.  We remained still, and awaited developments.</div><div class='line' id='LC9824'>The peasant toiled his difficult way up.  The king raised himself</div><div class='line' id='LC9825'>up and stood; he made a leg ready, and when the comer&#39;s head</div><div class='line' id='LC9826'>arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud, and down went the man</div><div class='line' id='LC9827'>floundering to the ground.  There was a wild outbreak of anger</div><div class='line' id='LC9828'>below, and the mob swarmed in from all around, and there we were</div><div class='line' id='LC9829'>treed, and prisoners.  Another man started up; the bridging bough</div><div class='line' id='LC9830'>was detected, and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished</div><div class='line' id='LC9831'>the bridge.  The king ordered me to play Horatius and keep the</div><div class='line' id='LC9832'>bridge.  For a while the enemy came thick and fast; but no matter,</div><div class='line' id='LC9833'>the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged</div><div class='line' id='LC9834'>him as soon as he came in reach.  The king&#39;s spirits rose, his joy</div><div class='line' id='LC9835'>was limitless.  He said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect</div><div class='line' id='LC9836'>we should have a beautiful night, for on this line of tactics we</div><div class='line' id='LC9837'>could hold the tree against the whole country-side.</div><div class='line' id='LC9838'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9839'>However, the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves; wherefore</div><div class='line' id='LC9840'>they called off the assault and began to debate other plans.</div><div class='line' id='LC9841'>They had no weapons, but there were plenty of stones, and stones</div><div class='line' id='LC9842'>might answer.  We had no objections.  A stone might possibly</div><div class='line' id='LC9843'>penetrate to us once in a while, but it wasn&#39;t very likely; we were</div><div class='line' id='LC9844'>well protected by boughs and foliage, and were not visible from</div><div class='line' id='LC9845'>any good aiming point.  If they would but waste half an hour in</div><div class='line' id='LC9846'>stone-throwing, the dark would come to our help.  We were feeling</div><div class='line' id='LC9847'>very well satisfied.  We could smile; almost laugh.</div><div class='line' id='LC9848'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9849'>But we didn&#39;t; which was just as well, for we should have been</div><div class='line' id='LC9850'>interrupted.  Before the stones had been raging through the leaves</div><div class='line' id='LC9851'>and bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes, we began to notice</div><div class='line' id='LC9852'>a smell.  A couple of sniffs of it was enough of an explanation</div><div class='line' id='LC9853'>--it was smoke!  Our game was up at last.  We recognized that.  When</div><div class='line' id='LC9854'>smoke invites you, you have to come.  They raised their pile of</div><div class='line' id='LC9855'>dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher, and when they saw</div><div class='line' id='LC9856'>the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree, they broke</div><div class='line' id='LC9857'>out in a storm of joy-clamors.  I got enough breath to say:</div><div class='line' id='LC9858'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9859'>&quot;Proceed, my liege; after you is manners.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9860'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9861'>The king gasped:</div><div class='line' id='LC9862'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9863'>&quot;Follow me down, and then back thyself against one side of the</div><div class='line' id='LC9864'>trunk, and leave me the other.  Then will we fight.  Let each pile</div><div class='line' id='LC9865'>his dead according to his own fashion and taste.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9866'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9867'>Then he descended, barking and coughing, and I followed.  I struck</div><div class='line' id='LC9868'>the ground an instant after him; we sprang to our appointed places,</div><div class='line' id='LC9869'>and began to give and take with all our might.  The powwow and</div><div class='line' id='LC9870'>racket were prodigious; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and</div><div class='line' id='LC9871'>thick-falling blows.  Suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst</div><div class='line' id='LC9872'>of the crowd, and a voice shouted:</div><div class='line' id='LC9873'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9874'>&quot;Hold--or ye are dead men!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9875'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9876'>How good it sounded!  The owner of the voice bore all the marks of</div><div class='line' id='LC9877'>a gentleman: picturesque and costly raiment, the aspect of command,</div><div class='line' id='LC9878'>a hard countenance, with complexion and features marred by dissipation.</div><div class='line' id='LC9879'>The mob fell humbly back, like so many spaniels.  The gentleman</div><div class='line' id='LC9880'>inspected us critically, then said sharply to the peasants:</div><div class='line' id='LC9881'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9882'>&quot;What are ye doing to these people?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9883'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9884'>&quot;They be madmen, worshipful sir, that have come wandering we know</div><div class='line' id='LC9885'>not whence, and--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9886'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9887'>&quot;Ye know not whence?  Do ye pretend ye know them not?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9888'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9889'>&quot;Most honored sir, we speak but the truth.  They are strangers</div><div class='line' id='LC9890'>and unknown to any in this region; and they be the most violent</div><div class='line' id='LC9891'>and bloodthirsty madmen that ever--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9892'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9893'>&quot;Peace!  Ye know not what ye say.  They are not mad.  Who are ye?</div><div class='line' id='LC9894'>And whence are ye?  Explain.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9895'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9896'>&quot;We are but peaceful strangers, sir,&quot; I said, &quot;and traveling upon</div><div class='line' id='LC9897'>our own concerns.  We are from a far country, and unacquainted</div><div class='line' id='LC9898'>here.  We have purposed no harm; and yet but for your brave</div><div class='line' id='LC9899'>interference and protection these people would have killed us.</div><div class='line' id='LC9900'>As you have divined, sir, we are not mad; neither are we violent</div><div class='line' id='LC9901'>or bloodthirsty.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9902'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9903'>The gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly: &quot;Lash me</div><div class='line' id='LC9904'>these animals to their kennels!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9905'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9906'>The mob vanished in an instant; and after them plunged the horsemen,</div><div class='line' id='LC9907'>laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down such</div><div class='line' id='LC9908'>as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the</div><div class='line' id='LC9909'>bush.  The shrieks and supplications presently died away in the</div><div class='line' id='LC9910'>distance, and soon the horsemen began to straggle back.  Meantime</div><div class='line' id='LC9911'>the gentleman had been questioning us more closely, but had dug</div><div class='line' id='LC9912'>no particulars out of us.  We were lavish of recognition of the</div><div class='line' id='LC9913'>service he was doing us, but we revealed nothing more than that we</div><div class='line' id='LC9914'>were friendless strangers from a far country.  When the escort were</div><div class='line' id='LC9915'>all returned, the gentleman said to one of his servants:</div><div class='line' id='LC9916'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9917'>&quot;Bring the led-horses and mount these people.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9918'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9919'>&quot;Yes, my lord.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9920'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9921'>We were placed toward the rear, among the servants.  We traveled</div><div class='line' id='LC9922'>pretty fast, and finally drew rein some time after dark at a</div><div class='line' id='LC9923'>roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our</div><div class='line' id='LC9924'>troubles.  My lord went immediately to his room, after ordering</div><div class='line' id='LC9925'>his supper, and we saw no more of him.  At dawn in the morning</div><div class='line' id='LC9926'>we breakfasted and made ready to start.</div><div class='line' id='LC9927'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9928'>My lord&#39;s chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with</div><div class='line' id='LC9929'>indolent grace, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC9930'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9931'>&quot;Ye have said ye should continue upon this road, which is our</div><div class='line' id='LC9932'>direction likewise; wherefore my lord, the earl Grip, hath given</div><div class='line' id='LC9933'>commandment that ye retain the horses and ride, and that certain</div><div class='line' id='LC9934'>of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight Cambenet,</div><div class='line' id='LC9935'>whenso ye shall be out of peril.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9936'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9937'>We could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the</div><div class='line' id='LC9938'>offer.  We jogged along, six in the party, at a moderate and</div><div class='line' id='LC9939'>comfortable gait, and in conversation learned that my lord Grip</div><div class='line' id='LC9940'>was a very great personage in his own region, which lay a day&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC9941'>journey beyond Cambenet.  We loitered to such a degree that it was</div><div class='line' id='LC9942'>near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square</div><div class='line' id='LC9943'>of the town.  We dismounted, and left our thanks once more for</div><div class='line' id='LC9944'>my lord, and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of</div><div class='line' id='LC9945'>the square, to see what might be the object of interest.  It was the</div><div class='line' id='LC9946'>remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves!  So they had</div><div class='line' id='LC9947'>been dragging their chains about, all this weary time.  That poor</div><div class='line' id='LC9948'>husband was gone, and also many others; and some few purchases</div><div class='line' id='LC9949'>had been added to the gang.  The king was not interested, and</div><div class='line' id='LC9950'>wanted to move along, but I was absorbed, and full of pity.  I could</div><div class='line' id='LC9951'>not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity.</div><div class='line' id='LC9952'>There they sat, grounded upon the ground, silent, uncomplaining,</div><div class='line' id='LC9953'>with bowed heads, a pathetic sight.  And by hideous contrast, a</div><div class='line' id='LC9954'>redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty</div><div class='line' id='LC9955'>steps away, in fulsome laudation of &quot;our glorious British liberties!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9956'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9957'>I was boiling.  I had forgotten I was a plebeian, I was remembering</div><div class='line' id='LC9958'>I was a man.  Cost what it might, I would mount that rostrum and--</div><div class='line' id='LC9959'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9960'>Click! the king and I were handcuffed together!  Our companions,</div><div class='line' id='LC9961'>those servants, had done it; my lord Grip stood looking on.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC9962'>king burst out in a fury, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC9963'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9964'>&quot;What meaneth this ill-mannered jest?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9965'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9966'>My lord merely said to his head miscreant, coolly:</div><div class='line' id='LC9967'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9968'>&quot;Put up the slaves and sell them!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9969'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9970'>_Slaves!_  The word had a new sound--and how unspeakably awful!  The</div><div class='line' id='LC9971'>king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly force;</div><div class='line' id='LC9972'>but my lord was out of the way when they arrived.  A dozen of</div><div class='line' id='LC9973'>the rascal&#39;s servants sprang forward, and in a moment we were</div><div class='line' id='LC9974'>helpless, with our hands bound behind us.  We so loudly and so</div><div class='line' id='LC9975'>earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen, that we got the interested</div><div class='line' id='LC9976'>attention of that liberty-mouthing orator and his patriotic crowd,</div><div class='line' id='LC9977'>and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude.</div><div class='line' id='LC9978'>The orator said:</div><div class='line' id='LC9979'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9980'>&quot;If, indeed, ye are freemen, ye have nought to fear--the God-given</div><div class='line' id='LC9981'>liberties of Britain are about ye for your shield and shelter!</div><div class='line' id='LC9982'>(Applause.)  Ye shall soon see. Bring forth your proofs.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9983'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9984'>&quot;What proofs?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9985'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9986'>&quot;Proof that ye are freemen.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9987'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9988'>Ah--I remembered!  I came to myself; I said nothing.  But the</div><div class='line' id='LC9989'>king stormed out:</div><div class='line' id='LC9990'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9991'>&quot;Thou&#39;rt insane, man.  It were better, and more in reason, that</div><div class='line' id='LC9992'>this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are _not_ freemen.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC9993'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9994'>You see, he knew his own laws just as other people so often know</div><div class='line' id='LC9995'>the laws; by words, not by effects.  They take a _meaning_, and get</div><div class='line' id='LC9996'>to be very vivid, when you come to apply them to yourself.</div><div class='line' id='LC9997'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC9998'>All hands shook their heads and looked disappointed; some turned</div><div class='line' id='LC9999'>away, no longer interested.  The orator said--and this time in the</div><div class='line' id='LC10000'>tones of business, not of sentiment:</div><div class='line' id='LC10001'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10002'>&quot;An ye do not know your country&#39;s laws, it were time ye learned</div><div class='line' id='LC10003'>them.  Ye are strangers to us; ye will not deny that. Ye may be</div><div class='line' id='LC10004'>freemen, we do not deny that; but also ye may be slaves.  The law</div><div class='line' id='LC10005'>is clear: it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves,</div><div class='line' id='LC10006'>it requireth you to prove ye are not.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10007'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10008'>I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC10009'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10010'>&quot;Dear sir, give us only time to send to Astolat; or give us only</div><div class='line' id='LC10011'>time to send to the Valley of Holiness--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10012'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10013'>&quot;Peace, good man, these are extraordinary requests, and you may</div><div class='line' id='LC10014'>not hope to have them granted.  It would cost much time, and would</div><div class='line' id='LC10015'>unwarrantably inconvenience your master--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10016'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10017'>&quot;_Master_, idiot!&quot; stormed the king.  &quot;I have no master, I myself</div><div class='line' id='LC10018'>am the m--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10019'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10020'>&quot;Silence, for God&#39;s sake!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10021'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10022'>I got the words out in time to stop the king.  We were in trouble</div><div class='line' id='LC10023'>enough already; it could not help us any to give these people</div><div class='line' id='LC10024'>the notion that we were lunatics.</div><div class='line' id='LC10025'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10026'>There is no use in stringing out the details.  The earl put us up</div><div class='line' id='LC10027'>and sold us at auction.  This same infernal law had existed in</div><div class='line' id='LC10028'>our own South in my own time, more than thirteen hundred years</div><div class='line' id='LC10029'>later, and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that</div><div class='line' id='LC10030'>they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without</div><div class='line' id='LC10031'>the circumstance making any particular impression upon me; but the</div><div class='line' id='LC10032'>minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience,</div><div class='line' id='LC10033'>a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly</div><div class='line' id='LC10034'>hellish.  Well, that&#39;s the way we are made.</div><div class='line' id='LC10035'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10036'>Yes, we were sold at auction, like swine.  In a big town and an</div><div class='line' id='LC10037'>active market we should have brought a good price; but this place</div><div class='line' id='LC10038'>was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me</div><div class='line' id='LC10039'>ashamed, every time I think of it.  The King of England brought</div><div class='line' id='LC10040'>seven dollars, and his prime minister nine; whereas the king was</div><div class='line' id='LC10041'>easily worth twelve dollars and I as easily worth fifteen.  But</div><div class='line' id='LC10042'>that is the way things always go; if you force a sale on a dull</div><div class='line' id='LC10043'>market, I don&#39;t care what the property is, you are going to make</div><div class='line' id='LC10044'>a poor business of it, and you can make up your mind to it.  If</div><div class='line' id='LC10045'>the earl had had wit enough to--</div><div class='line' id='LC10046'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10047'>However, there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up</div><div class='line' id='LC10048'>on his account.  Let him go, for the present; I took his number,</div><div class='line' id='LC10049'>so to speak.</div><div class='line' id='LC10050'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10051'>The slave-dealer bought us both, and hitched us onto that long</div><div class='line' id='LC10052'>chain of his, and we constituted the rear of his procession.  We</div><div class='line' id='LC10053'>took up our line of march and passed out of Cambenet at noon;</div><div class='line' id='LC10054'>and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the King</div><div class='line' id='LC10055'>of England and his chief minister, marching manacled and fettered</div><div class='line' id='LC10056'>and yoked, in a slave convoy, could move by all manner of idle men</div><div class='line' id='LC10057'>and women, and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely,</div><div class='line' id='LC10058'>and yet never attract a curious eye, never provoke a single remark.</div><div class='line' id='LC10059'>Dear, dear, it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king</div><div class='line' id='LC10060'>than there is about a tramp, after all.  He is just a cheap and</div><div class='line' id='LC10061'>hollow artificiality when you don&#39;t know he is a king.  But reveal</div><div class='line' id='LC10062'>his quality, and dear me it takes your very breath away to look</div><div class='line' id='LC10063'>at him.  I reckon we are all fools. Born so, no doubt.</div><div class='line' id='LC10064'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10065'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10066'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10067'>CHAPTER XXXV</div><div class='line' id='LC10068'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10069'>A PITIFUL INCIDENT</div><div class='line' id='LC10070'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10071'>It&#39;s a world of surprises.  The king brooded; this was natural.</div><div class='line' id='LC10072'>What would he brood about, should you say?  Why, about the prodigious</div><div class='line' id='LC10073'>nature of his fall, of course--from the loftiest place in the world</div><div class='line' id='LC10074'>to the lowest; from the most illustrious station in the world to</div><div class='line' id='LC10075'>the obscurest; from the grandest vocation among men to the basest.</div><div class='line' id='LC10076'>No, I take my oath that the thing that graveled him most, to start</div><div class='line' id='LC10077'>with, was not this, but the price he had fetched!  He couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC10078'>seem to get over that seven dollars.  Well, it stunned me so, when</div><div class='line' id='LC10079'>I first found it out, that I couldn&#39;t believe it; it didn&#39;t seem</div><div class='line' id='LC10080'>natural.  But as soon as my mental sight cleared and I got a right</div><div class='line' id='LC10081'>focus on it, I saw I was mistaken; it _was_ natural.  For this</div><div class='line' id='LC10082'>reason: a king is a mere artificiality, and so a king&#39;s feelings,</div><div class='line' id='LC10083'>like the impulses of an automatic doll, are mere artificialities;</div><div class='line' id='LC10084'>but as a man, he is a reality, and his feelings, as a man, are</div><div class='line' id='LC10085'>real, not phantoms.  It shames the average man to be valued below</div><div class='line' id='LC10086'>his own estimate of his worth, and the king certainly wasn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC10087'>anything more than an average man, if he was up that high.</div><div class='line' id='LC10088'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10089'>Confound him, he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything</div><div class='line' id='LC10090'>like a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars,</div><div class='line' id='LC10091'>sure--a thing which was plainly nonsense, and full or the baldest</div><div class='line' id='LC10092'>conceit; I wasn&#39;t worth it myself.  But it was tender ground for</div><div class='line' id='LC10093'>me to argue on.  In fact, I had to simply shirk argument and do</div><div class='line' id='LC10094'>the diplomatic instead.  I had to throw conscience aside, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10095'>brazenly concede that he ought to have brought twenty-five dollars;</div><div class='line' id='LC10096'>whereas I was quite well aware that in all the ages, the world had</div><div class='line' id='LC10097'>never seen a king that was worth half the money, and during the</div><div class='line' id='LC10098'>next thirteen centuries wouldn&#39;t see one that was worth the fourth</div><div class='line' id='LC10099'>of it.  Yes, he tired me.  If he began to talk about the crops;</div><div class='line' id='LC10100'>or about the recent weather; or about the condition of politics;</div><div class='line' id='LC10101'>or about dogs, or cats, or morals, or theology--no matter what</div><div class='line' id='LC10102'>--I sighed, for I knew what was coming; he was going to get out of it</div><div class='line' id='LC10103'>a palliation of that tiresome seven-dollar sale.  Wherever we</div><div class='line' id='LC10104'>halted where there was a crowd, he would give me a look which</div><div class='line' id='LC10105'>said plainly: &quot;if that thing could be tried over again now, with</div><div class='line' id='LC10106'>this kind of folk, you would see a different result.&quot;  Well, when</div><div class='line' id='LC10107'>he was first sold, it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven</div><div class='line' id='LC10108'>dollars; but before he was done with his sweating and worrying</div><div class='line' id='LC10109'>I wished he had fetched a hundred.  The thing never got a chance</div><div class='line' id='LC10110'>to die, for every day, at one place or another, possible purchasers</div><div class='line' id='LC10111'>looked us over, and, as often as any other way, their comment on</div><div class='line' id='LC10112'>the king was something like this:</div><div class='line' id='LC10113'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10114'>&quot;Here&#39;s a two-dollar-and-a-half chump with a thirty-dollar style.</div><div class='line' id='LC10115'>Pity but style was marketable.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10116'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10117'>At last this sort of remark produced an evil result.  Our owner</div><div class='line' id='LC10118'>was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be</div><div class='line' id='LC10119'>mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king.  So he went</div><div class='line' id='LC10120'>to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty.  I could have</div><div class='line' id='LC10121'>given the man some valuable advice, but I didn&#39;t; you mustn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC10122'>volunteer advice to a slave-driver unless you want to damage</div><div class='line' id='LC10123'>the cause you are arguing for.  I had found it a sufficiently</div><div class='line' id='LC10124'>difficult job to reduce the king&#39;s style to a peasant&#39;s style,</div><div class='line' id='LC10125'>even when he was a willing and anxious pupil; now then, to undertake</div><div class='line' id='LC10126'>to reduce the king&#39;s style to a slave&#39;s style--and by force--go to!</div><div class='line' id='LC10127'>it was a stately contract.  Never mind the details--it will save me</div><div class='line' id='LC10128'>trouble to let you imagine them.  I will only remark that at the</div><div class='line' id='LC10129'>end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club</div><div class='line' id='LC10130'>and fist had done their work well; the king&#39;s body was a sight</div><div class='line' id='LC10131'>to see--and to weep over; but his spirit?--why, it wasn&#39;t even</div><div class='line' id='LC10132'>phased.  Even that dull clod of a slave-driver was able to see</div><div class='line' id='LC10133'>that there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man</div><div class='line' id='LC10134'>till he dies; whose bones you can break, but whose manhood you</div><div class='line' id='LC10135'>can&#39;t.  This man found that from his first effort down to his</div><div class='line' id='LC10136'>latest, he couldn&#39;t ever come within reach of the king, but the</div><div class='line' id='LC10137'>king was ready to plunge for him, and did it.  So he gave up</div><div class='line' id='LC10138'>at last, and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired.</div><div class='line' id='LC10139'>The fact is, the king was a good deal more than a king, he was</div><div class='line' id='LC10140'>a man; and when a man is a man, you can&#39;t knock it out of him.</div><div class='line' id='LC10141'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10142'>We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth,</div><div class='line' id='LC10143'>and suffering.  And what Englishman was the most interested in</div><div class='line' id='LC10144'>the slavery question by that time?  His grace the king!  Yes; from</div><div class='line' id='LC10145'>being the most indifferent, he was become the most interested.</div><div class='line' id='LC10146'>He was become the bitterest hater of the institution I had ever</div><div class='line' id='LC10147'>heard talk.  And so I ventured to ask once more a question which</div><div class='line' id='LC10148'>I had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that</div><div class='line' id='LC10149'>I had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further.</div><div class='line' id='LC10150'>Would he abolish slavery?</div><div class='line' id='LC10151'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10152'>His answer was as sharp as before, but it was music this time;</div><div class='line' id='LC10153'>I shouldn&#39;t ever wish to hear pleasanter, though the profanity</div><div class='line' id='LC10154'>was not good, being awkwardly put together, and with the crash-word</div><div class='line' id='LC10155'>almost in the middle instead of at the end, where, of course, it</div><div class='line' id='LC10156'>ought to have been.</div><div class='line' id='LC10157'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10158'>I was ready and willing to get free now; I hadn&#39;t wanted to get</div><div class='line' id='LC10159'>free any sooner.  No, I cannot quite say that.  I had wanted to,</div><div class='line' id='LC10160'>but I had not been willing to take desperate chances, and had</div><div class='line' id='LC10161'>always dissuaded the king from them.  But now--ah, it was a new</div><div class='line' id='LC10162'>atmosphere!  Liberty would be worth any cost that might be put</div><div class='line' id='LC10163'>upon it now.  I set about a plan, and was straightway charmed</div><div class='line' id='LC10164'>with it.  It would require time, yes, and patience, too, a great</div><div class='line' id='LC10165'>deal of both.  One could invent quicker ways, and fully as sure</div><div class='line' id='LC10166'>ones; but none that would be as picturesque as this; none that</div><div class='line' id='LC10167'>could be made so dramatic.  And so I was not going to give this</div><div class='line' id='LC10168'>one up.  It might delay us months, but no matter, I would carry</div><div class='line' id='LC10169'>it out or break something.</div><div class='line' id='LC10170'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10171'>Now and then we had an adventure.  One night we were overtaken</div><div class='line' id='LC10172'>by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making</div><div class='line' id='LC10173'>for.  Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving</div><div class='line' id='LC10174'>snow was so thick.  You couldn&#39;t see a thing, and we were soon</div><div class='line' id='LC10175'>lost.  The slave-driver lashed us desperately, for he saw ruin</div><div class='line' id='LC10176'>before him, but his lashings only made matters worse, for they</div><div class='line' id='LC10177'>drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor.</div><div class='line' id='LC10178'>So we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we</div><div class='line' id='LC10179'>were.  The storm continued until toward midnight, then ceased.</div><div class='line' id='LC10180'>By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were</div><div class='line' id='LC10181'>dead, and others past moving and threatened with death.  Our</div><div class='line' id='LC10182'>master was nearly beside himself.  He stirred up the living, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10183'>made us stand, jump, slap ourselves, to restore our circulation,</div><div class='line' id='LC10184'>and he helped as well as he could with his whip.</div><div class='line' id='LC10185'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10186'>Now came a diversion.  We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a</div><div class='line' id='LC10187'>woman came running and crying; and seeing our group, she flung</div><div class='line' id='LC10188'>herself into our midst and begged for protection.  A mob of people</div><div class='line' id='LC10189'>came tearing after her, some with torches, and they said she was a</div><div class='line' id='LC10190'>witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease,</div><div class='line' id='LC10191'>and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black</div><div class='line' id='LC10192'>cat.  This poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked</div><div class='line' id='LC10193'>human, she was so battered and bloody.  The mob wanted to burn her.</div><div class='line' id='LC10194'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10195'>Well, now, what do you suppose our master did?  When we closed</div><div class='line' id='LC10196'>around this poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC10197'>said, burn her here, or they shouldn&#39;t have her at all.  Imagine</div><div class='line' id='LC10198'>that!  They were willing.  They fastened her to a post; they</div><div class='line' id='LC10199'>brought wood and piled it about her; they applied the torch while</div><div class='line' id='LC10200'>she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters</div><div class='line' id='LC10201'>to her breast; and our brute, with a heart solely for business,</div><div class='line' id='LC10202'>lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life</div><div class='line' id='LC10203'>and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent</div><div class='line' id='LC10204'>life of that poor harmless mother.  That was the sort of master we</div><div class='line' id='LC10205'>had.  I took _his_ number.  That snow-storm cost him nine of his</div><div class='line' id='LC10206'>flock; and he was more brutal to us than ever, after that, for</div><div class='line' id='LC10207'>many days together, he was so enraged over his loss.</div><div class='line' id='LC10208'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10209'>We had adventures all along.  One day we ran into a procession.</div><div class='line' id='LC10210'>And such a procession!  All the riffraff of the kingdom seemed</div><div class='line' id='LC10211'>to be comprehended in it; and all drunk at that.  In the van was</div><div class='line' id='LC10212'>a cart with a coffin in it, and on the coffin sat a comely young</div><div class='line' id='LC10213'>girl of about eighteen suckling a baby, which she squeezed to her</div><div class='line' id='LC10214'>breast in a passion of love every little while, and every little</div><div class='line' id='LC10215'>while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down</div><div class='line' id='LC10216'>upon it; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her,</div><div class='line' id='LC10217'>happy and content, kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand,</div><div class='line' id='LC10218'>which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart.</div><div class='line' id='LC10219'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10220'>Men and women, boys and girls, trotted along beside or after</div><div class='line' id='LC10221'>the cart, hooting, shouting profane and ribald remarks, singing</div><div class='line' id='LC10222'>snatches of foul song, skipping, dancing--a very holiday of</div><div class='line' id='LC10223'>hellions, a sickening sight.  We had struck a suburb of London,</div><div class='line' id='LC10224'>outside the walls, and this was a sample of one sort of London</div><div class='line' id='LC10225'>society.  Our master secured a good place for us near the gallows.</div><div class='line' id='LC10226'>A priest was in attendance, and he helped the girl climb up, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10227'>said comforting words to her, and made the under-sheriff provide</div><div class='line' id='LC10228'>a stool for her.  Then he stood there by her on the gallows, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10229'>for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his</div><div class='line' id='LC10230'>feet, then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away</div><div class='line' id='LC10231'>on every side occupying the vacancies far and near, and then began</div><div class='line' id='LC10232'>to tell the story of the case.  And there was pity in his voice</div><div class='line' id='LC10233'>--how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land!</div><div class='line' id='LC10234'>I remember every detail of what he said, except the words he said</div><div class='line' id='LC10235'>it in; and so I change it into my own words:</div><div class='line' id='LC10236'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10237'>&quot;Law is intended to mete out justice.  Sometimes it fails. This</div><div class='line' id='LC10238'>cannot be helped.  We can only grieve, and be resigned, and pray</div><div class='line' id='LC10239'>for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10240'>that his fellows may be few.  A law sends this poor young thing</div><div class='line' id='LC10241'>to death--and it is right.  But another law had placed her where</div><div class='line' id='LC10242'>she must commit her crime or starve with her child--and before God</div><div class='line' id='LC10243'>that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death!</div><div class='line' id='LC10244'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10245'>&quot;A little while ago this young thing, this child of eighteen years,</div><div class='line' id='LC10246'>was as happy a wife and mother as any in England; and her lips</div><div class='line' id='LC10247'>were blithe with song, which is the native speech of glad and</div><div class='line' id='LC10248'>innocent hearts.  Her young husband was as happy as she; for he was</div><div class='line' id='LC10249'>doing his whole duty, he worked early and late at his handicraft,</div><div class='line' id='LC10250'>his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned, he was prospering,</div><div class='line' id='LC10251'>he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family, he was</div><div class='line' id='LC10252'>adding his mite to the wealth of the nation.  By consent of a</div><div class='line' id='LC10253'>treacherous law, instant destruction fell upon this holy home and</div><div class='line' id='LC10254'>swept it away!  That young husband was waylaid and impressed,</div><div class='line' id='LC10255'>and sent to sea.  The wife knew nothing of it.  She sought him</div><div class='line' id='LC10256'>everywhere, she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications</div><div class='line' id='LC10257'>of her tears, the broken eloquence of her despair.  Weeks dragged</div><div class='line' id='LC10258'>by, she watching, waiting, hoping, her mind going slowly to wreck</div><div class='line' id='LC10259'>under the burden of her misery.  Little by little all her small</div><div class='line' id='LC10260'>possessions went for food.  When she could no longer pay her rent,</div><div class='line' id='LC10261'>they turned her out of doors.  She begged, while she had strength;</div><div class='line' id='LC10262'>when she was starving at last, and her milk failing, she stole a</div><div class='line' id='LC10263'>piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent,</div><div class='line' id='LC10264'>thinking to sell it and save her child.  But she was seen by the</div><div class='line' id='LC10265'>owner of the cloth.  She was put in jail and brought to trial.</div><div class='line' id='LC10266'>The man testified to the facts.  A plea was made for her, and her</div><div class='line' id='LC10267'>sorrowful story was told in her behalf.  She spoke, too, by</div><div class='line' id='LC10268'>permission, and said she did steal the cloth, but that her mind</div><div class='line' id='LC10269'>was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne</div><div class='line' id='LC10270'>with hunger all acts, criminal or other, swam meaningless through</div><div class='line' id='LC10271'>her brain and she knew nothing rightly, except that she was so</div><div class='line' id='LC10272'>hungry!  For a moment all were touched, and there was disposition</div><div class='line' id='LC10273'>to deal mercifully with her, seeing that she was so young and</div><div class='line' id='LC10274'>friendless, and her case so piteous, and the law that robbed her</div><div class='line' id='LC10275'>of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her</div><div class='line' id='LC10276'>transgression; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas</div><div class='line' id='LC10277'>these things were all true, and most pitiful as well, still there</div><div class='line' id='LC10278'>was much small theft in these days, and mistimed mercy here would</div><div class='line' id='LC10279'>be a danger to property--oh, my God, is there no property in ruined</div><div class='line' id='LC10280'>homes, and orphaned babes, and broken hearts that British law</div><div class='line' id='LC10281'>holds precious!--and so he must require sentence.</div><div class='line' id='LC10282'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10283'>&quot;When the judge put on his black cap, the owner of the stolen</div><div class='line' id='LC10284'>linen rose trembling up, his lip quivering, his face as gray as</div><div class='line' id='LC10285'>ashes; and when the awful words came, he cried out, &#39;Oh, poor</div><div class='line' id='LC10286'>child, poor child, I did not know it was death!&#39; and fell as a</div><div class='line' id='LC10287'>tree falls.  When they lifted him up his reason was gone; before</div><div class='line' id='LC10288'>the sun was set, he had taken his own life.  A kindly man; a man</div><div class='line' id='LC10289'>whose heart was right, at bottom; add his murder to this that</div><div class='line' id='LC10290'>is to be now done here; and charge them both where they belong</div><div class='line' id='LC10291'>--to the rulers and the bitter laws of Britain.  The time is come, my</div><div class='line' id='LC10292'>child; let me pray over thee--not _for_ thee, dear abused poor heart</div><div class='line' id='LC10293'>and innocent, but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death,</div><div class='line' id='LC10294'>who need it more.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10295'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10296'>After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl&#39;s neck,</div><div class='line' id='LC10297'>and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear,</div><div class='line' id='LC10298'>because she was devouring the baby all the time, wildly kissing it,</div><div class='line' id='LC10299'>and snatching it to her face and her breast, and drenching it</div><div class='line' id='LC10300'>with tears, and half moaning, half shrieking all the while, and the</div><div class='line' id='LC10301'>baby crowing, and laughing, and kicking its feet with delight over</div><div class='line' id='LC10302'>what it took for romp and play.  Even the hangman couldn&#39;t stand it,</div><div class='line' id='LC10303'>but turned away.  When all was ready the priest gently pulled and</div><div class='line' id='LC10304'>tugged and forced the child out of the mother&#39;s arms, and stepped</div><div class='line' id='LC10305'>quickly out of her reach; but she clasped her hands, and made a</div><div class='line' id='LC10306'>wild spring toward him, with a shriek; but the rope--and the</div><div class='line' id='LC10307'>under-sheriff--held her short.  Then she went on her knees and</div><div class='line' id='LC10308'>stretched out her hands and cried:</div><div class='line' id='LC10309'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10310'>&quot;One more kiss--oh, my God, one more, one more,--it is the dying</div><div class='line' id='LC10311'>that begs it!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10312'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10313'>She got it; she almost smothered the little thing.  And when they</div><div class='line' id='LC10314'>got it away again, she cried out:</div><div class='line' id='LC10315'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10316'>&quot;Oh, my child, my darling, it will die!  It has no home, it has</div><div class='line' id='LC10317'>no father, no friend, no mother--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10318'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10319'>&quot;It has them all!&quot; said that good priest.  &quot;All these will I be</div><div class='line' id='LC10320'>to it till I die.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10321'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10322'>You should have seen her face then!  Gratitude?  Lord, what do</div><div class='line' id='LC10323'>you want with words to express that?  Words are only painted fire;</div><div class='line' id='LC10324'>a look is the fire itself.  She gave that look, and carried it away</div><div class='line' id='LC10325'>to the treasury of heaven, where all things that are divine belong.</div><div class='line' id='LC10326'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10327'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10328'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10329'>CHAPTER XXXVI</div><div class='line' id='LC10330'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10331'>AN ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK</div><div class='line' id='LC10332'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10333'>London--to a slave--was a sufficiently interesting place.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC10334'>merely a great big village; and mainly mud and thatch.  The streets</div><div class='line' id='LC10335'>were muddy, crooked, unpaved.  The populace was an ever flocking</div><div class='line' id='LC10336'>and drifting swarm of rags, and splendors, of nodding plumes and</div><div class='line' id='LC10337'>shining armor.  The king had a palace there; he saw the outside</div><div class='line' id='LC10338'>of it.  It made him sigh; yes, and swear a little, in a poor</div><div class='line' id='LC10339'>juvenile sixth century way.  We saw knights and grandees whom</div><div class='line' id='LC10340'>we knew, but they didn&#39;t know us in our rags and dirt and raw</div><div class='line' id='LC10341'>welts and bruises, and wouldn&#39;t have recognized us if we had hailed</div><div class='line' id='LC10342'>them, nor stopped to answer, either, it being unlawful to speak</div><div class='line' id='LC10343'>with slaves on a chain.  Sandy passed within ten yards of me on</div><div class='line' id='LC10344'>a mule--hunting for me, I imagined.  But the thing which clean</div><div class='line' id='LC10345'>broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old</div><div class='line' id='LC10346'>barrack in a square, while we were enduring the spectacle of a man</div><div class='line' id='LC10347'>being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies.  It was</div><div class='line' id='LC10348'>the sight of a newsboy--and I couldn&#39;t get at him!  Still, I had</div><div class='line' id='LC10349'>one comfort--here was proof that Clarence was still alive and</div><div class='line' id='LC10350'>banging away.  I meant to be with him before long; the thought was</div><div class='line' id='LC10351'>full of cheer.</div><div class='line' id='LC10352'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10353'>I had one little glimpse of another thing, one day, which gave me</div><div class='line' id='LC10354'>a great uplift.  It was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop.</div><div class='line' id='LC10355'>Telegraph or telephone, sure.  I did very much wish I had a little</div><div class='line' id='LC10356'>piece of it.  It was just what I needed, in order to carry out my</div><div class='line' id='LC10357'>project of escape.  My idea was to get loose some night, along with</div><div class='line' id='LC10358'>the king, then gag and bind our master, change clothes with him,</div><div class='line' id='LC10359'>batter him into the aspect of a stranger, hitch him to the slave-chain,</div><div class='line' id='LC10360'>assume possession of the property, march to Camelot, and--</div><div class='line' id='LC10361'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10362'>But you get my idea; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise</div><div class='line' id='LC10363'>I would wind up with at the palace.  It was all feasible, if</div><div class='line' id='LC10364'>I could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which I could</div><div class='line' id='LC10365'>shape into a lock-pick.  I could then undo the lumbering padlocks</div><div class='line' id='LC10366'>with which our chains were fastened, whenever I might choose.</div><div class='line' id='LC10367'>But I never had any luck; no such thing ever happened to fall</div><div class='line' id='LC10368'>in my way.  However, my chance came at last.  A gentleman who</div><div class='line' id='LC10369'>had come twice before to dicker for me, without result, or indeed</div><div class='line' id='LC10370'>any approach to a result, came again.  I was far from expecting</div><div class='line' id='LC10371'>ever to belong to him, for the price asked for me from the time</div><div class='line' id='LC10372'>I was first enslaved was exorbitant, and always provoked either</div><div class='line' id='LC10373'>anger or derision, yet my master stuck stubbornly to it--twenty-two</div><div class='line' id='LC10374'>dollars.  He wouldn&#39;t bate a cent.  The king was greatly admired,</div><div class='line' id='LC10375'>because of his grand physique, but his kingly style was against</div><div class='line' id='LC10376'>him, and he wasn&#39;t salable; nobody wanted that kind of a slave.</div><div class='line' id='LC10377'>I considered myself safe from parting from him because of my</div><div class='line' id='LC10378'>extravagant price.  No, I was not expecting to ever belong to</div><div class='line' id='LC10379'>this gentleman whom I have spoken of, but he had something which</div><div class='line' id='LC10380'>I expected would belong to me eventually, if he would but visit</div><div class='line' id='LC10381'>us often enough.  It was a steel thing with a long pin to it, with</div><div class='line' id='LC10382'>which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in</div><div class='line' id='LC10383'>front.  There were three of them. He had disappointed me twice,</div><div class='line' id='LC10384'>because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project</div><div class='line' id='LC10385'>entirely safe; but this time I succeeded; I captured the lower</div><div class='line' id='LC10386'>clasp of the three, and when he missed it he thought he had lost</div><div class='line' id='LC10387'>it on the way.</div><div class='line' id='LC10388'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10389'>I had a chance to be glad about a minute, then straightway a chance</div><div class='line' id='LC10390'>to be sad again.  For when the purchase was about to fail, as usual,</div><div class='line' id='LC10391'>the master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus</div><div class='line' id='LC10392'>--in modern English:</div><div class='line' id='LC10393'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10394'>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;ll do.  I&#39;m tired supporting these two for</div><div class='line' id='LC10395'>no good.  Give me twenty-two dollars for this one, and I&#39;ll throw</div><div class='line' id='LC10396'>the other one in.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10397'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10398'>The king couldn&#39;t get his breath, he was in such a fury.  He began</div><div class='line' id='LC10399'>to choke and gag, and meantime the master and the gentleman moved</div><div class='line' id='LC10400'>away discussing.</div><div class='line' id='LC10401'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10402'>&quot;An ye will keep the offer open--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10403'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10404'>&quot;&#39;Tis open till the morrow at this hour.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10405'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10406'>&quot;Then I will answer you at that time,&quot; said the gentleman, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10407'>disappeared, the master following him.</div><div class='line' id='LC10408'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10409'>I had a time of it to cool the king down, but I managed it.</div><div class='line' id='LC10410'>I whispered in his ear, to this effect:</div><div class='line' id='LC10411'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10412'>&quot;Your grace _will_ go for nothing, but after another fashion.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC10413'>so shall I.  To-night we shall both be free.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10414'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10415'>&quot;Ah!  How is that?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10416'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10417'>&quot;With this thing which I have stolen, I will unlock these locks</div><div class='line' id='LC10418'>and cast off these chains to-night.  When he comes about nine-thirty</div><div class='line' id='LC10419'>to inspect us for the night, we will seize him, gag him, batter</div><div class='line' id='LC10420'>him, and early in the morning we will march out of this town,</div><div class='line' id='LC10421'>proprietors of this caravan of slaves.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10422'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10423'>That was as far as I went, but the king was charmed and satisfied.</div><div class='line' id='LC10424'>That evening we waited patiently for our fellow-slaves to get</div><div class='line' id='LC10425'>to sleep and signify it by the usual sign, for you must not take</div><div class='line' id='LC10426'>many chances on those poor fellows if you can avoid it.  It is</div><div class='line' id='LC10427'>best to keep your own secrets.  No doubt they fidgeted only about</div><div class='line' id='LC10428'>as usual, but it didn&#39;t seem so to me.  It seemed to me that they</div><div class='line' id='LC10429'>were going to be forever getting down to their regular snoring.</div><div class='line' id='LC10430'>As the time dragged on I got nervously afraid we shouldn&#39;t have</div><div class='line' id='LC10431'>enough of it left for our needs; so I made several premature</div><div class='line' id='LC10432'>attempts, and merely delayed things by it; for I couldn&#39;t seem</div><div class='line' id='LC10433'>to touch a padlock, there in the dark, without starting a rattle</div><div class='line' id='LC10434'>out of it which interrupted somebody&#39;s sleep and made him turn</div><div class='line' id='LC10435'>over and wake some more of the gang.</div><div class='line' id='LC10436'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10437'>But finally I did get my last iron off, and was a free man once</div><div class='line' id='LC10438'>more.  I took a good breath of relief, and reached for the king&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC10439'>irons.  Too late! in comes the master, with a light in one hand</div><div class='line' id='LC10440'>and his heavy walking-staff in the other.  I snuggled close among</div><div class='line' id='LC10441'>the wallow of snorers, to conceal as nearly as possible that I was</div><div class='line' id='LC10442'>naked of irons; and I kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring</div><div class='line' id='LC10443'>for my man the moment he should bend over me.</div><div class='line' id='LC10444'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10445'>But he didn&#39;t approach.  He stopped, gazed absently toward our</div><div class='line' id='LC10446'>dusky mass a minute, evidently thinking about something else;</div><div class='line' id='LC10447'>then set down his light, moved musingly toward the door, and before</div><div class='line' id='LC10448'>a body could imagine what he was going to do, he was out of the</div><div class='line' id='LC10449'>door and had closed it behind him.</div><div class='line' id='LC10450'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10451'>&quot;Quick!&quot; said the king.  &quot;Fetch him back!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10452'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10453'>Of course, it was the thing to do, and I was up and out in a</div><div class='line' id='LC10454'>moment.  But, dear me, there were no lamps in those days, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10455'>it was a dark night.  But I glimpsed a dim figure a few steps</div><div class='line' id='LC10456'>away.  I darted for it, threw myself upon it, and then there was</div><div class='line' id='LC10457'>a state of things and lively!  We fought and scuffled and struggled,</div><div class='line' id='LC10458'>and drew a crowd in no time.  They took an immense interest in</div><div class='line' id='LC10459'>the fight and encouraged us all they could, and, in fact, couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC10460'>have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had been their own</div><div class='line' id='LC10461'>fight.  Then a tremendous row broke out behind us, and as much</div><div class='line' id='LC10462'>as half of our audience left us, with a rush, to invest some</div><div class='line' id='LC10463'>sympathy in that.  Lanterns began to swing in all directions;</div><div class='line' id='LC10464'>it was the watch gathering from far and near.  Presently a halberd</div><div class='line' id='LC10465'>fell across my back, as a reminder, and I knew what it meant.</div><div class='line' id='LC10466'>I was in custody.  So was my adversary.  We were marched off toward</div><div class='line' id='LC10467'>prison, one on each side of the watchman.  Here was disaster,</div><div class='line' id='LC10468'>here was a fine scheme gone to sudden destruction!  I tried to</div><div class='line' id='LC10469'>imagine what would happen when the master should discover that</div><div class='line' id='LC10470'>it was I who had been fighting him; and what would happen if they</div><div class='line' id='LC10471'>jailed us together in the general apartment for brawlers and petty</div><div class='line' id='LC10472'>law-breakers, as was the custom; and what might--</div><div class='line' id='LC10473'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10474'>Just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction,</div><div class='line' id='LC10475'>the freckled light from the watchman&#39;s tin lantern fell on it,</div><div class='line' id='LC10476'>and, by George, he was the wrong man!</div><div class='line' id='LC10477'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10478'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10479'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10480'>CHAPTER XXXVII</div><div class='line' id='LC10481'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10482'>AN AWFUL PREDICAMENT</div><div class='line' id='LC10483'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10484'>Sleep?  It was impossible.  It would naturally have been impossible</div><div class='line' id='LC10485'>in that noisome cavern of a jail, with its mangy crowd of drunken,</div><div class='line' id='LC10486'>quarrelsome, and song-singing rapscallions.  But the thing that</div><div class='line' id='LC10487'>made sleep all the more a thing not to be dreamed of, was my</div><div class='line' id='LC10488'>racking impatience to get out of this place and find out the whole</div><div class='line' id='LC10489'>size of what might have happened yonder in the slave-quarters</div><div class='line' id='LC10490'>in consequence of that intolerable miscarriage of mine.</div><div class='line' id='LC10491'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10492'>It was a long night, but the morning got around at last.  I made</div><div class='line' id='LC10493'>a full and frank explanation to the court.  I said I was a slave,</div><div class='line' id='LC10494'>the property of the great Earl Grip, who had arrived just after</div><div class='line' id='LC10495'>dark at the Tabard inn in the village on the other side of the</div><div class='line' id='LC10496'>water, and had stopped there over night, by compulsion, he being</div><div class='line' id='LC10497'>taken deadly sick with a strange and sudden disorder.  I had been</div><div class='line' id='LC10498'>ordered to cross to the city in all haste and bring the best</div><div class='line' id='LC10499'>physician; I was doing my best; naturally I was running with all</div><div class='line' id='LC10500'>my might; the night was dark, I ran against this common person</div><div class='line' id='LC10501'>here, who seized me by the throat and began to pummel me, although</div><div class='line' id='LC10502'>I told him my errand, and implored him, for the sake of the great</div><div class='line' id='LC10503'>earl my master&#39;s mortal peril--</div><div class='line' id='LC10504'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10505'>The common person interrupted and said it was a lie; and was going</div><div class='line' id='LC10506'>to explain how I rushed upon him and attacked him without a word--</div><div class='line' id='LC10507'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10508'>&quot;Silence, sirrah!&quot; from the court.  &quot;Take him hence and give him</div><div class='line' id='LC10509'>a few stripes whereby to teach him how to treat the servant of</div><div class='line' id='LC10510'>a nobleman after a different fashion another time.  Go!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10511'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10512'>Then the court begged my pardon, and hoped I would not fail</div><div class='line' id='LC10513'>to tell his lordship it was in no wise the court&#39;s fault that this</div><div class='line' id='LC10514'>high-handed thing had happened.  I said I would make it all right,</div><div class='line' id='LC10515'>and so took my leave.  Took it just in time, too; he was starting</div><div class='line' id='LC10516'>to ask me why I didn&#39;t fetch out these facts the moment I was</div><div class='line' id='LC10517'>arrested.  I said I would if I had thought of it--which was true</div><div class='line' id='LC10518'>--but that I was so battered by that man that all my wit was knocked</div><div class='line' id='LC10519'>out of me--and so forth and so on, and got myself away, still</div><div class='line' id='LC10520'>mumbling.  I didn&#39;t wait for breakfast.  No grass grew under my</div><div class='line' id='LC10521'>feet.  I was soon at the slave quarters.  Empty--everybody gone!</div><div class='line' id='LC10522'>That is, everybody except one body--the slave-master&#39;s.  It lay</div><div class='line' id='LC10523'>there all battered to pulp; and all about were the evidences of</div><div class='line' id='LC10524'>a terrific fight.  There was a rude board coffin on a cart at</div><div class='line' id='LC10525'>the door, and workmen, assisted by the police, were thinning a</div><div class='line' id='LC10526'>road through the gaping crowd in order that they might bring it in.</div><div class='line' id='LC10527'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10528'>I picked out a man humble enough in life to condescend to talk</div><div class='line' id='LC10529'>with one so shabby as I, and got his account of the matter.</div><div class='line' id='LC10530'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10531'>&quot;There were sixteen slaves here.

How did it begin?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10535'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10536'>&quot;There was no witness but the slaves.

When</div><div class='line' id='LC10540'>the master discovered his loss, he was mad with despair, and threw</div><div class='line' id='LC10541'>himself upon his people with his heavy stick, who resisted and</div><div class='line' id='LC10542'>brake his back and in other and divers ways did give him hurts</div><div class='line' id='LC10543'>that brought him swiftly to his end.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10544'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10545'>&quot;This is dreadful.

Wit ye not the law?--which men</div><div class='line' id='LC10560'>say the Romans left behind them here when they went--that if one</div><div class='line' id='LC10561'>slave killeth his master all the slaves of that man must die for it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10562'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10563'>&quot;True.  I had forgotten.  And when will these die?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10564'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10565'>&quot;Belike within a four and twenty hours; albeit some say they will</div><div class='line' id='LC10566'>wait a pair of days more, if peradventure they may find the missing</div><div class='line' id='LC10567'>one meantime.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10568'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10569'>The missing one!  It made me feel uncomfortable.</div><div class='line' id='LC10570'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10571'>&quot;Is it likely they will find him?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10572'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10573'>&quot;Before the day is spent--yes.  They seek him everywhere.  They</div><div class='line' id='LC10574'>stand at the gates of the town, with certain of the slaves who</div><div class='line' id='LC10575'>will discover him to them if he cometh, and none can pass out</div><div class='line' id='LC10576'>but he will be first examined.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10577'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10578'>&quot;Might one see the place where the rest are confined?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10579'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10580'>&quot;The outside of it--yes.  The inside of it--but ye will not want</div><div class='line' id='LC10581'>to see that.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10582'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10583'>I took the address of that prison for future reference and then</div><div class='line' id='LC10584'>sauntered off.  At the first second-hand clothing shop I came to,</div><div class='line' id='LC10585'>up a back street, I got a rough rig suitable for a common seaman</div><div class='line' id='LC10586'>who might be going on a cold voyage, and bound up my face with</div><div class='line' id='LC10587'>a liberal bandage, saying I had a toothache.  This concealed my</div><div class='line' id='LC10588'>worst bruises.  It was a transformation.  I no longer resembled my</div><div class='line' id='LC10589'>former self.  Then I struck out for that wire, found it and</div><div class='line' id='LC10590'>followed it to its den.  It was a little room over a butcher&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC10591'>shop--which meant that business wasn&#39;t very brisk in the telegraphic</div><div class='line' id='LC10592'>line.  The young chap in charge was drowsing at his table.  I locked</div><div class='line' id='LC10593'>the door and put the vast key in my bosom.  This alarmed the young</div><div class='line' id='LC10594'>fellow, and he was going to make a noise; but I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC10595'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10596'>&quot;Save your wind; if you open your mouth you are dead, sure.  Tackle</div><div class='line' id='LC10597'>your instrument.  Lively, now!  Call Camelot.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10598'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10599'>&quot;This doth amaze me!  How should such as you know aught of such</div><div class='line' id='LC10600'>matters as--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10601'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10602'>&quot;Call Camelot!  I am a desperate man.  Call Camelot, or get away</div><div class='line' id='LC10603'>from the instrument and I will do it myself.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10604'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10605'>&quot;What--you?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10606'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10607'>&quot;Yes--certainly.  Stop gabbling.  Call the palace.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10608'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10609'>He made the call.</div><div class='line' id='LC10610'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10611'>&quot;Now, then, call Clarence.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10612'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10613'>&quot;Clarence _who_?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10614'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10615'>&quot;Never mind Clarence who.  Say you want Clarence; you&#39;ll get</div><div class='line' id='LC10616'>an answer.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10617'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10618'>He did so.  We waited five nerve-straining minutes--ten minutes</div><div class='line' id='LC10619'>--how long it did seem!--and then came a click that was as familiar</div><div class='line' id='LC10620'>to me as a human voice; for Clarence had been my own pupil.</div><div class='line' id='LC10621'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10622'>&quot;Now, my lad, vacate!  They would have known _my_ touch, maybe,</div><div class='line' id='LC10623'>and so your call was surest; but I&#39;m all right now.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10624'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10625'>He vacated the place and cocked his ear to listen--but it didn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC10626'>win.  I used a cipher.  I didn&#39;t waste any time in sociabilities</div><div class='line' id='LC10627'>with Clarence, but squared away for business, straight-off--thus:</div><div class='line' id='LC10628'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10629'>&quot;The king is here and in danger.  We were captured and brought</div><div class='line' id='LC10630'>here as slaves.  We should not be able to prove our identity</div><div class='line' id='LC10631'>--and the fact is, I am not in a position to try.  Send a telegram</div><div class='line' id='LC10632'>for the palace here which will carry conviction with it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10633'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10634'>His answer came straight back:</div><div class='line' id='LC10635'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10636'>&quot;They don&#39;t know anything about the telegraph; they haven&#39;t had</div><div class='line' id='LC10637'>any experience yet, the line to London is so new.  Better not</div><div class='line' id='LC10638'>venture that.  They might hang you.  Think up something else.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10639'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10640'>Might hang us!  Little he knew how closely he was crowding the</div><div class='line' id='LC10641'>facts.  I couldn&#39;t think up anything for the moment.  Then an idea</div><div class='line' id='LC10642'>struck me, and I started it along:</div><div class='line' id='LC10643'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10644'>&quot;Send five hundred picked knights with Launcelot in the lead; and</div><div class='line' id='LC10645'>send them on the jump.  Let them enter by the southwest gate, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10646'>look out for the man with a white cloth around his right arm.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10647'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10648'>The answer was prompt:</div><div class='line' id='LC10649'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10650'>&quot;They shall start in half an hour.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10651'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10652'>&quot;All right, Clarence; now tell this lad here that I&#39;m a friend</div><div class='line' id='LC10653'>of yours and a dead-head; and that he must be discreet and say</div><div class='line' id='LC10654'>nothing about this visit of mine.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10655'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10656'>The instrument began to talk to the youth and I hurried away.</div><div class='line' id='LC10657'>I fell to ciphering.  In half an hour it would be nine o&#39;clock.</div><div class='line' id='LC10658'>Knights and horses in heavy armor couldn&#39;t travel very fast.</div><div class='line' id='LC10659'>These would make the best time they could, and now that the ground</div><div class='line' id='LC10660'>was in good condition, and no snow or mud, they would probably</div><div class='line' id='LC10661'>make a seven-mile gait; they would have to change horses a couple</div><div class='line' id='LC10662'>of times; they would arrive about six, or a little after; it would</div><div class='line' id='LC10663'>still be plenty light enough; they would see the white cloth which</div><div class='line' id='LC10664'>I should tie around my right arm, and I would take command.  We</div><div class='line' id='LC10665'>would surround that prison and have the king out in no time.</div><div class='line' id='LC10666'>It would be showy and picturesque enough, all things considered,</div><div class='line' id='LC10667'>though I would have preferred noonday, on account of the more</div><div class='line' id='LC10668'>theatrical aspect the thing would have.</div><div class='line' id='LC10669'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10670'>Now, then, in order to increase the strings to my bow, I thought</div><div class='line' id='LC10671'>I would look up some of those people whom I had formerly recognized,</div><div class='line' id='LC10672'>and make myself known.  That would help us out of our scrape,</div><div class='line' id='LC10673'>without the knights.  But I must proceed cautiously, for it was</div><div class='line' id='LC10674'>a risky business.  I must get into sumptuous raiment, and it</div><div class='line' id='LC10675'>wouldn&#39;t do to run and jump into it.  No, I must work up to it</div><div class='line' id='LC10676'>by degrees, buying suit after suit of clothes, in shops wide apart,</div><div class='line' id='LC10677'>and getting a little finer article with each change, until I should</div><div class='line' id='LC10678'>finally reach silk and velvet, and be ready for my project.  So</div><div class='line' id='LC10679'>I started.</div><div class='line' id='LC10680'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10681'>But the scheme fell through like scat!  The first corner I turned,</div><div class='line' id='LC10682'>I came plump upon one of our slaves, snooping around with a watchman.</div><div class='line' id='LC10683'>I coughed at the moment, and he gave me a sudden look that bit right</div><div class='line' id='LC10684'>into my marrow.  I judge he thought he had heard that cough before.</div><div class='line' id='LC10685'>I turned immediately into a shop and worked along down the counter,</div><div class='line' id='LC10686'>pricing things and watching out of the corner of my eye.  Those</div><div class='line' id='LC10687'>people had stopped, and were talking together and looking in at</div><div class='line' id='LC10688'>the door.  I made up my mind to get out the back way, if there</div><div class='line' id='LC10689'>was a back way, and I asked the shopwoman if I could step out</div><div class='line' id='LC10690'>there and look for the escaped slave, who was believed to be in</div><div class='line' id='LC10691'>hiding back there somewhere, and said I was an officer in disguise,</div><div class='line' id='LC10692'>and my pard was yonder at the door with one of the murderers in</div><div class='line' id='LC10693'>charge, and would she be good enough to step there and tell him</div><div class='line' id='LC10694'>he needn&#39;t wait, but had better go at once to the further end of</div><div class='line' id='LC10695'>the back alley and be ready to head him off when I rousted him out.</div><div class='line' id='LC10696'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10697'>She was blazing with eagerness to see one of those already celebrated</div><div class='line' id='LC10698'>murderers, and she started on the errand at once.  I slipped out</div><div class='line' id='LC10699'>the back way, locked the door behind me, put the key in my pocket</div><div class='line' id='LC10700'>and started off, chuckling to myself and comfortable.</div><div class='line' id='LC10701'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10702'>Well, I had gone and spoiled it again, made another mistake.</div><div class='line' id='LC10703'>A double one, in fact.  There were plenty of ways to get rid of</div><div class='line' id='LC10704'>that officer by some simple and plausible device, but no, I must</div><div class='line' id='LC10705'>pick out a picturesque one; it is the crying defect of my character.</div><div class='line' id='LC10706'>And then, I had ordered my procedure upon what the officer, being</div><div class='line' id='LC10707'>human, would _naturally_ do; whereas when you are least expecting it,</div><div class='line' id='LC10708'>a man will now and then go and do the very thing which it&#39;s _not_</div><div class='line' id='LC10709'>natural for him to do.  The natural thing for the officer to do,</div><div class='line' id='LC10710'>in this case, was to follow straight on my heels; he would find</div><div class='line' id='LC10711'>a stout oaken door, securely locked, between him and me; before</div><div class='line' id='LC10712'>he could break it down, I should be far away and engaged in slipping</div><div class='line' id='LC10713'>into a succession of baffling disguises which would soon get me</div><div class='line' id='LC10714'>into a sort of raiment which was a surer protection from meddling</div><div class='line' id='LC10715'>law-dogs in Britain than any amount of mere innocence and purity</div><div class='line' id='LC10716'>of character.  But instead of doing the natural thing, the officer</div><div class='line' id='LC10717'>took me at my word, and followed my instructions.  And so, as I</div><div class='line' id='LC10718'>came trotting out of that cul de sac, full of satisfaction with my</div><div class='line' id='LC10719'>own cleverness, he turned the corner and I walked right into his</div><div class='line' id='LC10720'>handcuffs.  If I had known it was a cul de sac--however, there</div><div class='line' id='LC10721'>isn&#39;t any excusing a blunder like that, let it go.  Charge it up</div><div class='line' id='LC10722'>to profit and loss.</div><div class='line' id='LC10723'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10724'>Of course, I was indignant, and swore I had just come ashore from</div><div class='line' id='LC10725'>a long voyage, and all that sort of thing--just to see, you know,</div><div class='line' id='LC10726'>if it would deceive that slave.  But it didn&#39;t.  He knew me.  Then</div><div class='line' id='LC10727'>I reproached him for betraying me.  He was more surprised than</div><div class='line' id='LC10728'>hurt.  He stretched his eyes wide, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC10729'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10730'>&quot;What, wouldst have me let thee, of all men, escape and not hang</div><div class='line' id='LC10731'>with us, when thou&#39;rt the very _cause_ of our hanging?  Go to!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10732'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10733'>&quot;Go to&quot; was their way of saying &quot;I should smile!&quot; or &quot;I like that!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10734'>Queer talkers, those people.</div><div class='line' id='LC10735'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10736'>Well, there was a sort of bastard justice in his view of the case,</div><div class='line' id='LC10737'>and so I dropped the matter.  When you can&#39;t cure a disaster by</div><div class='line' id='LC10738'>argument, what is the use to argue?  It isn&#39;t my way.  So I only said:</div><div class='line' id='LC10739'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10740'>&quot;You&#39;re not going to be hanged.  None of us are.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10741'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10742'>Both men laughed, and the slave said:</div><div class='line' id='LC10743'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10744'>&quot;Ye have not ranked as a fool--before.  You might better keep</div><div class='line' id='LC10745'>your reputation, seeing the strain would not be for long.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10746'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10747'>&quot;It will stand it, I reckon.  Before to-morrow we shall be out</div><div class='line' id='LC10748'>of prison, and free to go where we will, besides.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10749'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10750'>The witty officer lifted at his left ear with his thumb, made</div><div class='line' id='LC10751'>a rasping noise in his throat, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC10752'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10753'>&quot;Out of prison--yes--ye say true.  And free likewise to go where</div><div class='line' id='LC10754'>ye will, so ye wander not out of his grace the Devil&#39;s sultry realm.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10755'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10756'>I kept my temper, and said, indifferently:</div><div class='line' id='LC10757'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10758'>&quot;Now I suppose you really think we are going to hang within</div><div class='line' id='LC10759'>a day or two.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10760'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10761'>&quot;I thought it not many minutes ago, for so the thing was decided</div><div class='line' id='LC10762'>and proclaimed.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10763'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10764'>&quot;Ah, then you&#39;ve changed your mind, is that it?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10765'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10766'>&quot;Even that.  I only _thought_, then; I _know_, now.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10767'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10768'>I felt sarcastical, so I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC10769'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10770'>&quot;Oh, sapient servant of the law, condescend to tell us, then,</div><div class='line' id='LC10771'>what you _know_.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10772'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10773'>&quot;That ye will all be hanged _to-day_, at mid-afternoon!  Oho! that</div><div class='line' id='LC10774'>shot hit home!  Lean upon me.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10775'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10776'>The fact is I did need to lean upon somebody.  My knights couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC10777'>arrive in time.  They would be as much as three hours too late.</div><div class='line' id='LC10778'>Nothing in the world could save the King of England; nor me, which</div><div class='line' id='LC10779'>was more important.  More important, not merely to me, but to</div><div class='line' id='LC10780'>the nation--the only nation on earth standing ready to blossom</div><div class='line' id='LC10781'>into civilization.  I was sick.  I said no more, there wasn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC10782'>anything to say.  I knew what the man meant; that if the missing</div><div class='line' id='LC10783'>slave was found, the postponement would be revoked, the execution</div><div class='line' id='LC10784'>take place to-day.  Well, the missing slave was found.</div><div class='line' id='LC10785'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10786'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10787'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10788'>CHAPTER XXXVIII</div><div class='line' id='LC10789'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10790'>SIR LAUNCELOT AND KNIGHTS TO THE RESCUE</div><div class='line' id='LC10791'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10792'>Nearing four in the afternoon.  The scene was just outside the</div><div class='line' id='LC10793'>walls of London.  A cool, comfortable, superb day, with a brilliant</div><div class='line' id='LC10794'>sun; the kind of day to make one want to live, not die.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC10795'>multitude was prodigious and far-reaching; and yet we fifteen</div><div class='line' id='LC10796'>poor devils hadn&#39;t a friend in it.  There was something painful</div><div class='line' id='LC10797'>in that thought, look at it how you might.  There we sat, on our</div><div class='line' id='LC10798'>tall scaffold, the butt of the hate and mockery of all those</div><div class='line' id='LC10799'>enemies.  We were being made a holiday spectacle.  They had built</div><div class='line' id='LC10800'>a sort of grand stand for the nobility and gentry, and these were</div><div class='line' id='LC10801'>there in full force, with their ladies.  We recognized a good</div><div class='line' id='LC10802'>many of them.</div><div class='line' id='LC10803'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10804'>The crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of</div><div class='line' id='LC10805'>the king.  The moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up,</div><div class='line' id='LC10806'>in his fantastic rags, with face bruised out of all recognition, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10807'>proclaimed himself Arthur, King of Britain, and denounced the</div><div class='line' id='LC10808'>awful penalties of treason upon every soul there present if hair</div><div class='line' id='LC10809'>of his sacred head were touched.  It startled and surprised him</div><div class='line' id='LC10810'>to hear them break into a vast roar of laughter.  It wounded his</div><div class='line' id='LC10811'>dignity, and he locked himself up in silence.  Then, although</div><div class='line' id='LC10812'>the crowd begged him to go on, and tried to provoke him to it</div><div class='line' id='LC10813'>by catcalls, jeers, and shouts of:</div><div class='line' id='LC10814'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10815'>&quot;Let him speak!  The king!  The king! his humble subjects hunger</div><div class='line' id='LC10816'>and thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master</div><div class='line' id='LC10817'>his Serene and Sacred Raggedness!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC10818'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10819'>But it went for nothing.  He put on all his majesty and sat under</div><div class='line' id='LC10820'>this rain of contempt and insult unmoved.  He certainly was great</div><div class='line' id='LC10821'>in his way.  Absently, I had taken off my white bandage and wound</div><div class='line' id='LC10822'>it about my right arm.  When the crowd noticed this, they began</div><div class='line' id='LC10823'>upon me.

All other topics sank into insignificance and</div><div class='line' id='LC10967'>passed out of men&#39;s thoughts and interest.  It was not because</div><div class='line' id='LC10968'>a tournament was a great matter, it was not because Sir Sagramor</div><div class='line' id='LC10969'>had found the Holy Grail, for he had not, but had failed; it was</div><div class='line' id='LC10970'>not because the second (official) personage in the kingdom was</div><div class='line' id='LC10971'>one of the duellists; no, all these features were commonplace.</div><div class='line' id='LC10972'>Yet there was abundant reason for the extraordinary interest which</div><div class='line' id='LC10973'>this coming fight was creating.  It was born of the fact that all</div><div class='line' id='LC10974'>the nation knew that this was not to be a duel between mere men,</div><div class='line' id='LC10975'>so to speak, but a duel between two mighty magicians; a duel not</div><div class='line' id='LC10976'>of muscle but of mind, not of human skill but of superhuman art</div><div class='line' id='LC10977'>and craft; a final struggle for supremacy between the two master</div><div class='line' id='LC10978'>enchanters of the age.  It was realized that the most prodigious</div><div class='line' id='LC10979'>achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy</div><div class='line' id='LC10980'>of comparison with a spectacle like this; they could be but child&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC10981'>play, contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods.</div><div class='line' id='LC10982'>Yes, all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel</div><div class='line' id='LC10983'>between Merlin and me, a measuring of his magic powers against</div><div class='line' id='LC10984'>mine.  It was known that Merlin had been busy whole days and nights</div><div class='line' id='LC10985'>together, imbuing Sir Sagramor&#39;s arms and armor with supernal</div><div class='line' id='LC10986'>powers of offense and defense, and that he had procured for him</div><div class='line' id='LC10987'>from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the</div><div class='line' id='LC10988'>wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other</div><div class='line' id='LC10989'>men.  Against Sir Sagramor, so weaponed and protected, a thousand</div><div class='line' id='LC10990'>knights could accomplish nothing; against him no known enchantments</div><div class='line' id='LC10991'>could prevail.  These facts were sure; regarding them there was</div><div class='line' id='LC10992'>no doubt, no reason for doubt.  There was but one question: might</div><div class='line' id='LC10993'>there be still other enchantments, _unknown_ to Merlin, which could</div><div class='line' id='LC10994'>render Sir Sagramor&#39;s veil transparent to me, and make his enchanted</div><div class='line' id='LC10995'>mail vulnerable to my weapons?  This was the one thing to be</div><div class='line' id='LC10996'>decided in the lists.  Until then the world must remain in suspense.</div><div class='line' id='LC10997'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC10998'>So the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here, and</div><div class='line' id='LC10999'>the world was right, but it was not the one they had in their</div><div class='line' id='LC11000'>minds.  No, a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die:</div><div class='line' id='LC11001'>_the life of knight-errantry_.  I was a champion, it was true, but</div><div class='line' id='LC11002'>not the champion of the frivolous black arts, I was the champion</div><div class='line' id='LC11003'>of hard unsentimental common-sense and reason.  I was entering</div><div class='line' id='LC11004'>the lists to either destroy knight-errantry or be its victim.</div><div class='line' id='LC11005'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11006'>Vast as the show-grounds were, there were no vacant spaces in them</div><div class='line' id='LC11007'>outside of the lists, at ten o&#39;clock on the morning of the 16th.</div><div class='line' id='LC11008'>The mammoth grand-stand was clothed in flags, streamers, and rich</div><div class='line' id='LC11009'>tapestries, and packed with several acres of small-fry tributary</div><div class='line' id='LC11010'>kings, their suites, and the British aristocracy; with our own</div><div class='line' id='LC11011'>royal gang in the chief place, and each and every individual</div><div class='line' id='LC11012'>a flashing prism of gaudy silks and velvets--well, I never saw</div><div class='line' id='LC11013'>anything to begin with it but a fight between an Upper Mississippi</div><div class='line' id='LC11014'>sunset and the aurora borealis.  The huge camp of beflagged and</div><div class='line' id='LC11015'>gay-colored tents at one end of the lists, with a stiff-standing</div><div class='line' id='LC11016'>sentinel at every door and a shining shield hanging by him for</div><div class='line' id='LC11017'>challenge, was another fine sight.  You see, every knight was</div><div class='line' id='LC11018'>there who had any ambition or any caste feeling; for my feeling</div><div class='line' id='LC11019'>toward their order was not much of a secret, and so here was their</div><div class='line' id='LC11020'>chance.  If I won my fight with Sir Sagramor, others would have</div><div class='line' id='LC11021'>the right to call me out as long as I might be willing to respond.</div><div class='line' id='LC11022'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11023'>Down at our end there were but two tents; one for me, and another</div><div class='line' id='LC11024'>for my servants.  At the appointed hour the king made a sign, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11025'>the heralds, in their tabards, appeared and made proclamation,</div><div class='line' id='LC11026'>naming the combatants and stating the cause of quarrel.  There</div><div class='line' id='LC11027'>was a pause, then a ringing bugle-blast, which was the signal for</div><div class='line' id='LC11028'>us to come forth.  All the multitude caught their breath, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11029'>an eager curiosity flashed into every face.</div><div class='line' id='LC11030'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11031'>Out from his tent rode great Sir Sagramor, an imposing tower</div><div class='line' id='LC11032'>of iron, stately and rigid, his huge spear standing upright in its</div><div class='line' id='LC11033'>socket and grasped in his strong hand, his grand horse&#39;s face and</div><div class='line' id='LC11034'>breast cased in steel, his body clothed in rich trappings that</div><div class='line' id='LC11035'>almost dragged the ground--oh, a most noble picture.  A great</div><div class='line' id='LC11036'>shout went up, of welcome and admiration.</div><div class='line' id='LC11037'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11038'>And then out I came.  But I didn&#39;t get any shout.  There was</div><div class='line' id='LC11039'>a wondering and eloquent silence for a moment, then a great wave</div><div class='line' id='LC11040'>of laughter began to sweep along that human sea, but a warning</div><div class='line' id='LC11041'>bugle-blast cut its career short.  I was in the simplest and</div><div class='line' id='LC11042'>comfortablest of gymnast costumes--flesh-colored tights from neck</div><div class='line' id='LC11043'>to heel, with blue silk puffings about my loins, and bareheaded.</div><div class='line' id='LC11044'>My horse was not above medium size, but he was alert, slender-limbed,</div><div class='line' id='LC11045'>muscled with watchsprings, and just a greyhound to go.  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC11046'>a beauty, glossy as silk, and naked as he was when he was born,</div><div class='line' id='LC11047'>except for bridle and ranger-saddle.</div><div class='line' id='LC11048'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11049'>The iron tower and the gorgeous bedquilt came cumbrously but</div><div class='line' id='LC11050'>gracefully pirouetting down the lists, and we tripped lightly up</div><div class='line' id='LC11051'>to meet them.  We halted; the tower saluted, I responded; then</div><div class='line' id='LC11052'>we wheeled and rode side by side to the grand-stand and faced</div><div class='line' id='LC11053'>our king and queen, to whom we made obeisance.  The queen exclaimed:</div><div class='line' id='LC11054'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11055'>&quot;Alack, Sir Boss, wilt fight naked, and without lance or sword or--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11056'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11057'>But the king checked her and made her understand, with a polite</div><div class='line' id='LC11058'>phrase or two, that this was none of her business.  The bugles</div><div class='line' id='LC11059'>rang again; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists,</div><div class='line' id='LC11060'>and took position.  Now old Merlin stepped into view and cast</div><div class='line' id='LC11061'>a dainty web of gossamer threads over Sir Sagramor which turned</div><div class='line' id='LC11062'>him into Hamlet&#39;s ghost; the king made a sign, the bugles blew,</div><div class='line' id='LC11063'>Sir Sagramor laid his great lance in rest, and the next moment here</div><div class='line' id='LC11064'>he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind,</div><div class='line' id='LC11065'>and I went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him</div><div class='line' id='LC11066'>--cocking my ear the while, as if noting the invisible knight&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC11067'>position and progress by hearing, not sight.  A chorus of encouraging</div><div class='line' id='LC11068'>shouts burst out for him, and one brave voice flung out a heartening</div><div class='line' id='LC11069'>word for me--said:</div><div class='line' id='LC11070'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11071'>&quot;Go it, slim Jim!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11072'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11073'>It was an even bet that Clarence had procured that favor for me</div><div class='line' id='LC11074'>--and furnished the language, too.  When that formidable lance-point</div><div class='line' id='LC11075'>was within a yard and a half of my breast I twitched my horse aside</div><div class='line' id='LC11076'>without an effort, and the big knight swept by, scoring a blank.</div><div class='line' id='LC11077'>I got plenty of applause that time.  We turned, braced up, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11078'>down we came again.  Another blank for the knight, a roar of</div><div class='line' id='LC11079'>applause for me.  This same thing was repeated once more; and</div><div class='line' id='LC11080'>it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that Sir Sagramor lost his</div><div class='line' id='LC11081'>temper, and at once changed his tactics and set himself the task</div><div class='line' id='LC11082'>of chasing me down.  Why, he hadn&#39;t any show in the world at that;</div><div class='line' id='LC11083'>it was a game of tag, with all the advantage on my side; I whirled</div><div class='line' id='LC11084'>out of his path with ease whenever I chose, and once I slapped him</div><div class='line' id='LC11085'>on the back as I went to the rear.  Finally I took the chase into</div><div class='line' id='LC11086'>my own hands; and after that, turn, or twist, or do what he would,</div><div class='line' id='LC11087'>he was never able to get behind me again; he found himself always</div><div class='line' id='LC11088'>in front at the end of his maneuver.  So he gave up that business</div><div class='line' id='LC11089'>and retired to his end of the lists.  His temper was clear gone now,</div><div class='line' id='LC11090'>and he forgot himself and flung an insult at me which disposed</div><div class='line' id='LC11091'>of mine.  I slipped my lasso from the horn of my saddle, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11092'>grasped the coil in my right hand.  This time you should have seen</div><div class='line' id='LC11093'>him come!--it was a business trip, sure; by his gait there was</div><div class='line' id='LC11094'>blood in his eye.  I was sitting my horse at ease, and swinging</div><div class='line' id='LC11095'>the great loop of my lasso in wide circles about my head; the</div><div class='line' id='LC11096'>moment he was under way, I started for him; when the space between</div><div class='line' id='LC11097'>us had narrowed to forty feet, I sent the snaky spirals of the rope</div><div class='line' id='LC11098'>a-cleaving through the air, then darted aside and faced about and</div><div class='line' id='LC11099'>brought my trained animal to a halt with all his feet braced under</div><div class='line' id='LC11100'>him for a surge.  The next moment the rope sprang taut and yanked</div><div class='line' id='LC11101'>Sir Sagramor out of the saddle!  Great Scott, but there was</div><div class='line' id='LC11102'>a sensation!</div><div class='line' id='LC11103'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11104'>Unquestionably, the popular thing in this world is novelty.  These</div><div class='line' id='LC11105'>people had never seen anything of that cowboy business before,</div><div class='line' id='LC11106'>and it carried them clear off their feet with delight.  From all</div><div class='line' id='LC11107'>around and everywhere, the shout went up:</div><div class='line' id='LC11108'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11109'>&quot;Encore! encore!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11110'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11111'>I wondered where they got the word, but there was no time to cipher</div><div class='line' id='LC11112'>on philological matters, because the whole knight-errantry hive</div><div class='line' id='LC11113'>was just humming now, and my prospect for trade couldn&#39;t have</div><div class='line' id='LC11114'>been better.  The moment my lasso was released and Sir Sagramor</div><div class='line' id='LC11115'>had been assisted to his tent, I hauled in the slack, took my</div><div class='line' id='LC11116'>station and began to swing my loop around my head again.  I was</div><div class='line' id='LC11117'>sure to have use for it as soon as they could elect a successor</div><div class='line' id='LC11118'>for Sir Sagramor, and that couldn&#39;t take long where there were</div><div class='line' id='LC11119'>so many hungry candidates.  Indeed, they elected one straight off</div><div class='line' id='LC11120'>--Sir Hervis de Revel.</div><div class='line' id='LC11121'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11122'>_Bzz_!  Here he came, like a house afire; I dodged: he passed like</div><div class='line' id='LC11123'>a flash, with my horse-hair coils settling around his neck;</div><div class='line' id='LC11124'>a second or so later, _fst_! his saddle was empty.</div><div class='line' id='LC11125'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11126'>I got another encore; and another, and another, and still another.</div><div class='line' id='LC11127'>When I had snaked five men out, things began to look serious to</div><div class='line' id='LC11128'>the ironclads, and they stopped and consulted together.  As a</div><div class='line' id='LC11129'>result, they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send</div><div class='line' id='LC11130'>their greatest and best against me.  To the astonishment of that</div><div class='line' id='LC11131'>little world, I lassoed Sir Lamorak de Galis, and after him</div><div class='line' id='LC11132'>Sir Galahad.  So you see there was simply nothing to be done now,</div><div class='line' id='LC11133'>but play their right bower--bring out the superbest of the superb,</div><div class='line' id='LC11134'>the mightiest of the mighty, the great Sir Launcelot himself!</div><div class='line' id='LC11135'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11136'>A proud moment for me?  I should think so.  Yonder was Arthur,</div><div class='line' id='LC11137'>King of Britain; yonder was Guenever; yes, and whole tribes of</div><div class='line' id='LC11138'>little provincial kings and kinglets; and in the tented camp yonder,</div><div class='line' id='LC11139'>renowned knights from many lands; and likewise the selectest body</div><div class='line' id='LC11140'>known to chivalry, the Knights of the Table Round, the most</div><div class='line' id='LC11141'>illustrious in Christendom; and biggest fact of all, the very sun</div><div class='line' id='LC11142'>of their shining system was yonder couching his lance, the focal</div><div class='line' id='LC11143'>point of forty thousand adoring eyes; and all by myself, here was</div><div class='line' id='LC11144'>I laying for him.  Across my mind flitted the dear image of a</div><div class='line' id='LC11145'>certain hello-girl of West Hartford, and I wished she could see</div><div class='line' id='LC11146'>me now.  In that moment, down came the Invincible, with the rush</div><div class='line' id='LC11147'>of a whirlwind--the courtly world rose to its feet and bent forward</div><div class='line' id='LC11148'>--the fateful coils went circling through the air, and before you</div><div class='line' id='LC11149'>could wink I was towing Sir Launcelot across the field on his</div><div class='line' id='LC11150'>back, and kissing my hand to the storm of waving kerchiefs and</div><div class='line' id='LC11151'>the thunder-crash of applause that greeted me!</div><div class='line' id='LC11152'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11153'>Said I to myself, as I coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddle-horn,</div><div class='line' id='LC11154'>and sat there drunk with glory, &quot;The victory is perfect--no other</div><div class='line' id='LC11155'>will venture against me--knight-errantry is dead.&quot;  Now imagine my</div><div class='line' id='LC11156'>astonishment--and everybody else&#39;s, too--to hear the peculiar</div><div class='line' id='LC11157'>bugle-call which announces that another competitor is about to</div><div class='line' id='LC11158'>enter the lists!  There was a mystery here; I couldn&#39;t account for</div><div class='line' id='LC11159'>this thing.  Next, I noticed Merlin gliding away from me; and then</div><div class='line' id='LC11160'>I noticed that my lasso was gone!  The old sleight-of-hand expert</div><div class='line' id='LC11161'>had stolen it, sure, and slipped it under his robe.</div><div class='line' id='LC11162'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11163'>The bugle blew again.  I looked, and down came Sagramor riding</div><div class='line' id='LC11164'>again, with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely re-arranged.</div><div class='line' id='LC11165'>I trotted up to meet him, and pretended to find him by the sound</div><div class='line' id='LC11166'>of his horse&#39;s hoofs.  He said:</div><div class='line' id='LC11167'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11168'>&quot;Thou&#39;rt quick of ear, but it will not save thee from this!&quot; and</div><div class='line' id='LC11169'>he touched the hilt of his great sword.  &quot;An ye are not able to see</div><div class='line' id='LC11170'>it, because of the influence of the veil, know that it is no cumbrous</div><div class='line' id='LC11171'>lance, but a sword--and I ween ye will not be able to avoid it.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11172'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11173'>His visor was up; there was death in his smile.  I should never</div><div class='line' id='LC11174'>be able to dodge his sword, that was plain.  Somebody was going</div><div class='line' id='LC11175'>to die this time.  If he got the drop on me, I could name the</div><div class='line' id='LC11176'>corpse.  We rode forward together, and saluted the royalties.</div><div class='line' id='LC11177'>This time the king was disturbed.  He said:</div><div class='line' id='LC11178'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11179'>&quot;Where is thy strange weapon?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11180'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11181'>&quot;It is stolen, sire.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11182'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11183'>&quot;Hast another at hand?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11184'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11185'>&quot;No, sire, I brought only the one.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11186'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11187'>Then Merlin mixed in:</div><div class='line' id='LC11188'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11189'>&quot;He brought but the one because there was but the one to bring.</div><div class='line' id='LC11190'>There exists none other but that one.  It belongeth to the king</div><div class='line' id='LC11191'>of the Demons of the Sea.  This man is a pretender, and ignorant,</div><div class='line' id='LC11192'>else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts</div><div class='line' id='LC11193'>only, and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11194'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11195'>&quot;Then is he weaponless,&quot; said the king.  &quot;Sir Sagramore, ye will</div><div class='line' id='LC11196'>grant him leave to borrow.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11197'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11198'>&quot;And I will lend!&quot; said Sir Launcelot, limping up.  &quot;He is as</div><div class='line' id='LC11199'>brave a knight of his hands as any that be on live, and he shall</div><div class='line' id='LC11200'>have mine.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11201'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11202'>He put his hand on his sword to draw it, but Sir Sagramor said:</div><div class='line' id='LC11203'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11204'>&quot;Stay, it may not be.  He shall fight with his own weapons; it</div><div class='line' id='LC11205'>was his privilege to choose them and bring them.

Wouldst kill a naked man?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11210'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11211'>&quot;An he do it, he shall answer it to me,&quot; said Sir Launcelot.</div><div class='line' id='LC11212'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11213'>&quot;I will answer it to any he that desireth!&quot; retorted Sir Sagramor hotly.</div><div class='line' id='LC11214'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11215'>Merlin broke in, rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest</div><div class='line' id='LC11216'>smile of malicious gratification:</div><div class='line' id='LC11217'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11218'>&quot;&#39;Tis well said, right well said!  And &#39;tis enough of parleying,</div><div class='line' id='LC11219'>let my lord the king deliver the battle signal.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11220'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11221'>The king had to yield.  The bugle made proclamation, and we turned</div><div class='line' id='LC11222'>apart and rode to our stations.  There we stood, a hundred yards</div><div class='line' id='LC11223'>apart, facing each other, rigid and motionless, like horsed statues.</div><div class='line' id='LC11224'>And so we remained, in a soundless hush, as much as a full minute,</div><div class='line' id='LC11225'>everybody gazing, nobody stirring.  It seemed as if the king could</div><div class='line' id='LC11226'>not take heart to give the signal.  But at last he lifted his hand,</div><div class='line' id='LC11227'>the clear note of the bugle followed, Sir Sagramor&#39;s long blade</div><div class='line' id='LC11228'>described a flashing curve in the air, and it was superb to see him</div><div class='line' id='LC11229'>come.  I sat still.  On he came.  I did not move.  People got so</div><div class='line' id='LC11230'>excited that they shouted to me:</div><div class='line' id='LC11231'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11232'>&quot;Fly, fly!  Save thyself!  This is murther!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11233'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11234'>I never budged so much as an inch till that thundering apparition</div><div class='line' id='LC11235'>had got within fifteen paces of me; then I snatched a dragoon</div><div class='line' id='LC11236'>revolver out of my holster, there was a flash and a roar, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11237'>the revolver was back in the holster before anybody could tell</div><div class='line' id='LC11238'>what had happened.</div><div class='line' id='LC11239'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11240'>Here was a riderless horse plunging by, and yonder lay Sir Sagramor,</div><div class='line' id='LC11241'>stone dead.</div><div class='line' id='LC11242'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11243'>The people that ran to him were stricken dumb to find that the life</div><div class='line' id='LC11244'>was actually gone out of the man and no reason for it visible,</div><div class='line' id='LC11245'>no hurt upon his body, nothing like a wound.  There was a hole</div><div class='line' id='LC11246'>through the breast of his chain-mail, but they attached no importance</div><div class='line' id='LC11247'>to a little thing like that; and as a bullet wound there produces</div><div class='line' id='LC11248'>but little blood, none came in sight because of the clothing and</div><div class='line' id='LC11249'>swaddlings under the armor.  The body was dragged over to let</div><div class='line' id='LC11250'>the king and the swells look down upon it.  They were stupefied</div><div class='line' id='LC11251'>with astonishment naturally.  I was requested to come and explain</div><div class='line' id='LC11252'>the miracle.  But I remained in my tracks, like a statue, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC11253'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11254'>&quot;If it is a command, I will come, but my lord the king knows that</div><div class='line' id='LC11255'>I am where the laws of combat require me to remain while any desire</div><div class='line' id='LC11256'>to come against me.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11257'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11258'>I waited.  Nobody challenged.  Then I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC11259'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11260'>&quot;If there are any who doubt that this field is well and fairly won,</div><div class='line' id='LC11261'>I do not wait for them to challenge me, I challenge them.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11262'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11263'>&quot;It is a gallant offer,&quot; said the king, &quot;and well beseems you.</div><div class='line' id='LC11264'>Whom will you name first?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11265'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11266'>&quot;I name none, I challenge all!  Here I stand, and dare the chivalry</div><div class='line' id='LC11267'>of England to come against me--not by individuals, but in mass!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11268'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11269'>&quot;What!&quot; shouted a score of knights.</div><div class='line' id='LC11270'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11271'>&quot;You have heard the challenge.  Take it, or I proclaim you recreant</div><div class='line' id='LC11272'>knights and vanquished, every one!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11273'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11274'>It was a &quot;bluff&quot; you know.  At such a time it is sound judgment</div><div class='line' id='LC11275'>to put on a bold face and play your hand for a hundred times what</div><div class='line' id='LC11276'>it is worth; forty-nine times out of fifty nobody dares to &quot;call,&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11277'>and you rake in the chips.  But just this once--well, things looked</div><div class='line' id='LC11278'>squally!  In just no time, five hundred knights were scrambling</div><div class='line' id='LC11279'>into their saddles, and before you could wink a widely scattering</div><div class='line' id='LC11280'>drove were under way and clattering down upon me.  I snatched</div><div class='line' id='LC11281'>both revolvers from the holsters and began to measure distances</div><div class='line' id='LC11282'>and calculate chances.</div><div class='line' id='LC11283'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11284'>Bang!  One saddle empty.  Bang! another one.  Bang--bang, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11285'>I bagged two.  Well, it was nip and tuck with us, and I knew it.</div><div class='line' id='LC11286'>If I spent the eleventh shot without convincing these people,</div><div class='line' id='LC11287'>the twelfth man would kill me, sure.  And so I never did feel</div><div class='line' id='LC11288'>so happy as I did when my ninth downed its man and I detected</div><div class='line' id='LC11289'>the wavering in the crowd which is premonitory of panic.  An instant</div><div class='line' id='LC11290'>lost now could knock out my last chance.  But I didn&#39;t lose it.</div><div class='line' id='LC11291'>I raised both revolvers and pointed them--the halted host stood</div><div class='line' id='LC11292'>their ground just about one good square moment, then broke and fled.</div><div class='line' id='LC11293'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11294'>The day was mine.  Knight-errantry was a doomed institution.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC11295'>march of civilization was begun.  How did I feel?  Ah, you never</div><div class='line' id='LC11296'>could imagine it.</div><div class='line' id='LC11297'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11298'>And Brer Merlin?  His stock was flat again.  Somehow, every time</div><div class='line' id='LC11299'>the magic of fol-de-rol tried conclusions with the magic of science,</div><div class='line' id='LC11300'>the magic of fol-de-rol got left.</div><div class='line' id='LC11301'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11302'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11303'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11304'>CHAPTER XL</div><div class='line' id='LC11305'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11306'>THREE YEARS LATER</div><div class='line' id='LC11307'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11308'>When I broke the back of knight-errantry that time, I no longer</div><div class='line' id='LC11309'>felt obliged to work in secret.  So, the very next day I exposed</div><div class='line' id='LC11310'>my hidden schools, my mines, and my vast system of clandestine</div><div class='line' id='LC11311'>factories and workshops to an astonished world.  That is to say,</div><div class='line' id='LC11312'>I exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of the sixth.</div><div class='line' id='LC11313'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11314'>Well, it is always a good plan to follow up an advantage promptly.</div><div class='line' id='LC11315'>The knights were temporarily down, but if I would keep them so</div><div class='line' id='LC11316'>I must just simply paralyze them--nothing short of that would</div><div class='line' id='LC11317'>answer.  You see, I was &quot;bluffing&quot; that last time in the field;</div><div class='line' id='LC11318'>it would be natural for them to work around to that conclusion,</div><div class='line' id='LC11319'>if I gave them a chance.  So I must not give them time; and I didn&#39;t.</div><div class='line' id='LC11320'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11321'>I renewed my challenge, engraved it on brass, posted it up where</div><div class='line' id='LC11322'>any priest could read it to them, and also kept it standing in</div><div class='line' id='LC11323'>the advertising columns of the paper.</div><div class='line' id='LC11324'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11325'>I not only renewed it, but added to its proportions.  I said,</div><div class='line' id='LC11326'>name the day, and I would take fifty assistants and stand up</div><div class='line' id='LC11327'>_against the massed chivalry of the whole earth and destroy it_.</div><div class='line' id='LC11328'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11329'>I was not bluffing this time.

Even the dullest of the chivalry perceived</div><div class='line' id='LC11332'>that this was a plain case of &quot;put up, or shut up.&quot;  They were</div><div class='line' id='LC11333'>wise and did the latter.  In all the next three years they gave</div><div class='line' id='LC11334'>me no trouble worth mentioning.</div><div class='line' id='LC11335'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11336'>Consider the three years sped.  Now look around on England.  A happy</div><div class='line' id='LC11337'>and prosperous country, and strangely altered.  Schools everywhere,</div><div class='line' id='LC11338'>and several colleges; a number of pretty good newspapers.  Even</div><div class='line' id='LC11339'>authorship was taking a start; Sir Dinadan the Humorist was first</div><div class='line' id='LC11340'>in the field, with a volume of gray-headed jokes which I had been</div><div class='line' id='LC11341'>familiar with during thirteen centuries.  If he had left out that</div><div class='line' id='LC11342'>old rancid one about the lecturer I wouldn&#39;t have said anything;</div><div class='line' id='LC11343'>but I couldn&#39;t stand that one.

The telegraph, the telephone, the</div><div class='line' id='LC11348'>phonograph, the typewriter, the sewing-machine, and all the thousand</div><div class='line' id='LC11349'>willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working</div><div class='line' id='LC11350'>their way into favor.  We had a steamboat or two on the Thames,</div><div class='line' id='LC11351'>we had steam warships, and the beginnings of a steam commercial</div><div class='line' id='LC11352'>marine; I was getting ready to send out an expedition to discover</div><div class='line' id='LC11353'>America.</div><div class='line' id='LC11354'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11355'>We were building several lines of railway, and our line from</div><div class='line' id='LC11356'>Camelot to London was already finished and in operation.  I was</div><div class='line' id='LC11357'>shrewd enough to make all offices connected with the passenger</div><div class='line' id='LC11358'>service places of high and distinguished honor.  My idea was</div><div class='line' id='LC11359'>to attract the chivalry and nobility, and make them useful and keep</div><div class='line' id='LC11360'>them out of mischief.  The plan worked very well, the competition</div><div class='line' id='LC11361'>for the places was hot.  The conductor of the 4.33 express was</div><div class='line' id='LC11362'>a duke; there wasn&#39;t a passenger conductor on the line below</div><div class='line' id='LC11363'>the degree of earl.  They were good men, every one, but they had</div><div class='line' id='LC11364'>two defects which I couldn&#39;t cure, and so had to wink at: they</div><div class='line' id='LC11365'>wouldn&#39;t lay aside their armor, and they would &quot;knock down&quot; fare</div><div class='line' id='LC11366'>--I mean rob the company.</div><div class='line' id='LC11367'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11368'>There was hardly a knight in all the land who wasn&#39;t in some useful</div><div class='line' id='LC11369'>employment.  They were going from end to end of the country in all</div><div class='line' id='LC11370'>manner of useful missionary capacities; their penchant for wandering,</div><div class='line' id='LC11371'>and their experience in it, made them altogether the most effective</div><div class='line' id='LC11372'>spreaders of civilization we had.  They went clothed in steel and</div><div class='line' id='LC11373'>equipped with sword and lance and battle-axe, and if they couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC11374'>persuade a person to try a sewing-machine on the installment plan,</div><div class='line' id='LC11375'>or a melodeon, or a barbed-wire fence, or a prohibition journal,</div><div class='line' id='LC11376'>or any of the other thousand and one things they canvassed for,</div><div class='line' id='LC11377'>they removed him and passed on.</div><div class='line' id='LC11378'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11379'>I was very happy.  Things were working steadily toward a secretly</div><div class='line' id='LC11380'>longed-for point.  You see, I had two schemes in my head which</div><div class='line' id='LC11381'>were the vastest of all my projects.  The one was to overthrow the</div><div class='line' id='LC11382'>Catholic Church and set up the Protestant faith on its ruins</div><div class='line' id='LC11383'>--not as an Established Church, but a go-as-you-please one; and</div><div class='line' id='LC11384'>the other project was to get a decree issued by and by, commanding</div><div class='line' id='LC11385'>that upon Arthur&#39;s death unlimited suffrage should be introduced,</div><div class='line' id='LC11386'>and given to men and women alike--at any rate to all men, wise</div><div class='line' id='LC11387'>or unwise, and to all mothers who at middle age should be found</div><div class='line' id='LC11388'>to know nearly as much as their sons at twenty-one.  Arthur was</div><div class='line' id='LC11389'>good for thirty years yet, he being about my own age--that is</div><div class='line' id='LC11390'>to say, forty--and I believed that in that time I could easily</div><div class='line' id='LC11391'>have the active part of the population of that day ready and eager</div><div class='line' id='LC11392'>for an event which should be the first of its kind in the history</div><div class='line' id='LC11393'>of the world--a rounded and complete governmental revolution</div><div class='line' id='LC11394'>without bloodshed.  The result to be a republic.  Well, I may</div><div class='line' id='LC11395'>as well confess, though I do feel ashamed when I think of it:</div><div class='line' id='LC11396'>I was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president</div><div class='line' id='LC11397'>myself.  Yes, there was more or less human nature in me; I found</div><div class='line' id='LC11398'>that out.</div><div class='line' id='LC11399'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11400'>Clarence was with me as concerned the revolution, but in a modified</div><div class='line' id='LC11401'>way.  His idea was a republic, without privileged orders, but with</div><div class='line' id='LC11402'>a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective</div><div class='line' id='LC11403'>chief magistrate.  He believed that no nation that had ever known</div><div class='line' id='LC11404'>the joy of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it</div><div class='line' id='LC11405'>and not fade away and die of melancholy.  I urged that kings were</div><div class='line' id='LC11406'>dangerous.  He said, then have cats.  He was sure that a royal</div><div class='line' id='LC11407'>family of cats would answer every purpose.  They would be as useful</div><div class='line' id='LC11408'>as any other royal family, they would know as much, they would</div><div class='line' id='LC11409'>have the same virtues and the same treacheries, the same disposition</div><div class='line' id='LC11410'>to get up shindies with other royal cats, they would be laughably</div><div class='line' id='LC11411'>vain and absurd and never know it, they would be wholly inexpensive;</div><div class='line' id='LC11412'>finally, they would have as sound a divine right as any other</div><div class='line' id='LC11413'>royal house, and &quot;Tom VII, or Tom XI, or Tom XIV by the grace</div><div class='line' id='LC11414'>of God King,&quot; would sound as well as it would when applied to</div><div class='line' id='LC11415'>the ordinary royal tomcat with tights on.  &quot;And as a rule,&quot; said</div><div class='line' id='LC11416'>he, in his neat modern English, &quot;the character of these cats would</div><div class='line' id='LC11417'>be considerably above the character of the average king, and this</div><div class='line' id='LC11418'>would be an immense moral advantage to the nation, for the reason</div><div class='line' id='LC11419'>that a nation always models its morals after its monarch&#39;s.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC11420'>worship of royalty being founded in unreason, these graceful and</div><div class='line' id='LC11421'>harmless cats would easily become as sacred as any other royalties,</div><div class='line' id='LC11422'>and indeed more so, because it would presently be noticed that</div><div class='line' id='LC11423'>they hanged nobody, beheaded nobody, imprisoned nobody, inflicted</div><div class='line' id='LC11424'>no cruelties or injustices of any sort, and so must be worthy of</div><div class='line' id='LC11425'>a deeper love and reverence than the customary human king, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11426'>would certainly get it.  The eyes of the whole harried world would</div><div class='line' id='LC11427'>soon be fixed upon this humane and gentle system, and royal butchers</div><div class='line' id='LC11428'>would presently begin to disappear; their subjects would fill</div><div class='line' id='LC11429'>the vacancies with catlings from our own royal house; we should</div><div class='line' id='LC11430'>become a factory; we should supply the thrones of the world; within</div><div class='line' id='LC11431'>forty years all Europe would be governed by cats, and we should</div><div class='line' id='LC11432'>furnish the cats.  The reign of universal peace would begin then,</div><div class='line' id='LC11433'>to end no more forever....  Me-e-e-yow-ow-ow-ow--fzt!--wow!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11434'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11435'>Hang him, I supposed he was in earnest, and was beginning to be</div><div class='line' id='LC11436'>persuaded by him, until he exploded that cat-howl and startled me</div><div class='line' id='LC11437'>almost out of my clothes.  But he never could be in earnest.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC11438'>didn&#39;t know what it was.  He had pictured a distinct and perfectly</div><div class='line' id='LC11439'>rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy,</div><div class='line' id='LC11440'>but he was too feather-headed to know it, or care anything about</div><div class='line' id='LC11441'>it, either.  I was going to give him a scolding, but Sandy came</div><div class='line' id='LC11442'>flying in at that moment, wild with terror, and so choked with sobs</div><div class='line' id='LC11443'>that for a minute she could not get her voice.  I ran and took her</div><div class='line' id='LC11444'>in my arms, and lavished caresses upon her and said, beseechingly:</div><div class='line' id='LC11445'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11446'>&quot;Speak, darling, speak!  What is it?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11447'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11448'>Her head fell limp upon my bosom, and she gasped, almost inaudibly:</div><div class='line' id='LC11449'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11450'>&quot;HELLO-CENTRAL!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11451'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11452'>&quot;Quick!&quot; I shouted to Clarence; &quot;telephone the king&#39;s homeopath</div><div class='line' id='LC11453'>to come!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11454'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11455'>In two minutes I was kneeling by the child&#39;s crib, and Sandy was</div><div class='line' id='LC11456'>dispatching servants here, there, and everywhere, all over the</div><div class='line' id='LC11457'>palace.  I took in the situation almost at a glance--membranous</div><div class='line' id='LC11458'>croup!  I bent down and whispered:</div><div class='line' id='LC11459'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11460'>&quot;Wake up, sweetheart!  Hello-Central.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11461'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11462'>She opened her soft eyes languidly, and made out to say:</div><div class='line' id='LC11463'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11464'>&quot;Papa.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11465'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11466'>That was a comfort.  She was far from dead yet.  I sent for</div><div class='line' id='LC11467'>preparations of sulphur, I rousted out the croup-kettle myself;</div><div class='line' id='LC11468'>for I don&#39;t sit down and wait for doctors when Sandy or the child</div><div class='line' id='LC11469'>is sick.  I knew how to nurse both of them, and had had experience.</div><div class='line' id='LC11470'>This little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life,</div><div class='line' id='LC11471'>and often I could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh</div><div class='line' id='LC11472'>through the tear-dews on its eye-lashes when even its mother couldn&#39;t.</div><div class='line' id='LC11473'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11474'>Sir Launcelot, in his richest armor, came striding along the great</div><div class='line' id='LC11475'>hall now on his way to the stock-board; he was president of the</div><div class='line' id='LC11476'>stock-board, and occupied the Siege Perilous, which he had bought</div><div class='line' id='LC11477'>of Sir Galahad; for the stock-board consisted of the Knights of</div><div class='line' id='LC11478'>the Round Table, and they used the Round Table for business purposes</div><div class='line' id='LC11479'>now.  Seats at it were worth--well, you would never believe the</div><div class='line' id='LC11480'>figure, so it is no use to state it.  Sir Launcelot was a bear, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11481'>he had put up a corner in one of the new lines, and was just getting</div><div class='line' id='LC11482'>ready to squeeze the shorts to-day; but what of that?  He was</div><div class='line' id='LC11483'>the same old Launcelot, and when he glanced in as he was passing</div><div class='line' id='LC11484'>the door and found out that his pet was sick, that was enough</div><div class='line' id='LC11485'>for him; bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all</div><div class='line' id='LC11486'>him, he would come right in here and stand by little Hello-Central</div><div class='line' id='LC11487'>for all he was worth.  And that was what he did.  He shied his</div><div class='line' id='LC11488'>helmet into the corner, and in half a minute he had a new wick</div><div class='line' id='LC11489'>in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup-kettle.  By this</div><div class='line' id='LC11490'>time Sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib, and everything</div><div class='line' id='LC11491'>was ready.</div><div class='line' id='LC11492'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11493'>Sir Launcelot got up steam, he and I loaded up the kettle with</div><div class='line' id='LC11494'>unslaked lime and carbolic acid, with a touch of lactic acid added</div><div class='line' id='LC11495'>thereto, then filled the thing up with water and inserted the</div><div class='line' id='LC11496'>steam-spout under the canopy.  Everything was ship-shape now,</div><div class='line' id='LC11497'>and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch.</div><div class='line' id='LC11498'>Sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple</div><div class='line' id='LC11499'>of church-wardens with willow-bark and sumach-tobacco for us,</div><div class='line' id='LC11500'>and told us to smoke as much as we pleased, it couldn&#39;t get under</div><div class='line' id='LC11501'>the canopy, and she was used to smoke, being the first lady in the</div><div class='line' id='LC11502'>land who had ever seen a cloud blown.  Well, there couldn&#39;t be</div><div class='line' id='LC11503'>a more contented or comfortable sight than Sir Launcelot in his</div><div class='line' id='LC11504'>noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard</div><div class='line' id='LC11505'>of snowy church-warden.  He was a beautiful man, a lovely man,</div><div class='line' id='LC11506'>and was just intended to make a wife and children happy.  But, of</div><div class='line' id='LC11507'>course Guenever--however, it&#39;s no use to cry over what&#39;s done and</div><div class='line' id='LC11508'>can&#39;t be helped.</div><div class='line' id='LC11509'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11510'>Well, he stood watch-and-watch with me, right straight through,</div><div class='line' id='LC11511'>for three days and nights, till the child was out of danger; then</div><div class='line' id='LC11512'>he took her up in his great arms and kissed her, with his plumes</div><div class='line' id='LC11513'>falling about her golden head, then laid her softly in Sandy&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC11514'>lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall, between</div><div class='line' id='LC11515'>the ranks of admiring men-at-arms and menials, and so disappeared.</div><div class='line' id='LC11516'>And no instinct warned me that I should never look upon him again</div><div class='line' id='LC11517'>in this world!  Lord, what a world of heart-break it is.</div><div class='line' id='LC11518'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11519'>The doctors said we must take the child away, if we would coax</div><div class='line' id='LC11520'>her back to health and strength again.  And she must have sea-air.</div><div class='line' id='LC11521'>So we took a man-of-war, and a suite of two hundred and sixty</div><div class='line' id='LC11522'>persons, and went cruising about, and after a fortnight of this we</div><div class='line' id='LC11523'>stepped ashore on the French coast, and the doctors thought it</div><div class='line' id='LC11524'>would be a good idea to make something of a stay there.  The little</div><div class='line' id='LC11525'>king of that region offered us his hospitalities, and we were glad</div><div class='line' id='LC11526'>to accept.  If he had had as many conveniences as he lacked, we</div><div class='line' id='LC11527'>should have been plenty comfortable enough; even as it was, we</div><div class='line' id='LC11528'>made out very well, in his queer old castle, by the help of comforts</div><div class='line' id='LC11529'>and luxuries from the ship.</div><div class='line' id='LC11530'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11531'>At the end of a month I sent the vessel home for fresh supplies,</div><div class='line' id='LC11532'>and for news.  We expected her back in three or four days.  She</div><div class='line' id='LC11533'>would bring me, along with other news, the result of a certain</div><div class='line' id='LC11534'>experiment which I had been starting.  It was a project of mine</div><div class='line' id='LC11535'>to replace the tournament with something which might furnish an</div><div class='line' id='LC11536'>escape for the extra steam of the chivalry, keep those bucks</div><div class='line' id='LC11537'>entertained and out of mischief, and at the same time preserve</div><div class='line' id='LC11538'>the best thing in them, which was their hardy spirit of emulation.</div><div class='line' id='LC11539'>I had had a choice band of them in private training for some time,</div><div class='line' id='LC11540'>and the date was now arriving for their first public effort.</div><div class='line' id='LC11541'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11542'>This experiment was baseball.  In order to give the thing vogue</div><div class='line' id='LC11543'>from the start, and place it out of the reach of criticism, I chose</div><div class='line' id='LC11544'>my nines by rank, not capacity.  There wasn&#39;t a knight in either</div><div class='line' id='LC11545'>team who wasn&#39;t a sceptered sovereign.  As for material of this</div><div class='line' id='LC11546'>sort, there was a glut of it always around Arthur.  You couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC11547'>throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king.  Of course,</div><div class='line' id='LC11548'>I couldn&#39;t get these people to leave off their armor; they wouldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC11549'>do that when they bathed.  They consented to differentiate the</div><div class='line' id='LC11550'>armor so that a body could tell one team from the other, but that</div><div class='line' id='LC11551'>was the most they would do.  So, one of the teams wore chain-mail</div><div class='line' id='LC11552'>ulsters, and the other wore plate-armor made of my new Bessemer</div><div class='line' id='LC11553'>steel.  Their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing I</div><div class='line' id='LC11554'>ever saw.  Being ball-proof, they never skipped out of the way,</div><div class='line' id='LC11555'>but stood still and took the result; when a Bessemer was at the bat</div><div class='line' id='LC11556'>and a ball hit him, it would bound a hundred and fifty yards</div><div class='line' id='LC11557'>sometimes.  And when a man was running, and threw himself on his</div><div class='line' id='LC11558'>stomach to slide to his base, it was like an iron-clad coming into</div><div class='line' id='LC11559'>port.  At first I appointed men of no rank to act as umpires, but</div><div class='line' id='LC11560'>I had to discontinue that.  These people were no easier to please</div><div class='line' id='LC11561'>than other nines.  The umpire&#39;s first decision was usually his</div><div class='line' id='LC11562'>last; they broke him in two with a bat, and his friends toted him</div><div class='line' id='LC11563'>home on a shutter.  When it was noticed that no umpire ever survived</div><div class='line' id='LC11564'>a game, umpiring got to be unpopular.  So I was obliged to appoint</div><div class='line' id='LC11565'>somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would</div><div class='line' id='LC11566'>protect him.</div><div class='line' id='LC11567'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11568'>Here are the names of the nines:</div><div class='line' id='LC11569'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11570'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BESSEMERS                   ULSTERS</div><div class='line' id='LC11571'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11572'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING ARTHUR.

She had</div><div class='line' id='LC11604'>hunted Britain over for me; had found me at the hanging-bout</div><div class='line' id='LC11605'>outside of London, and had straightway resumed her old place at</div><div class='line' id='LC11606'>my side in the placidest way and as of right.  I was a New Englander,</div><div class='line' id='LC11607'>and in my opinion this sort of partnership would compromise her,</div><div class='line' id='LC11608'>sooner or later.

There is no place for comparison between</div><div class='line' id='LC11618'>the two friendships; the one is earthly, the other divine.</div><div class='line' id='LC11619'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11620'>In my dreams, along at first, I still wandered thirteen centuries</div><div class='line' id='LC11621'>away, and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up</div><div class='line' id='LC11622'>and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world.  Many a</div><div class='line' id='LC11623'>time Sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep.</div><div class='line' id='LC11624'>With a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our</div><div class='line' id='LC11625'>child, conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine.</div><div class='line' id='LC11626'>It touched me to tears, and it also nearly knocked me off my feet,</div><div class='line' id='LC11627'>too, when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward, and played</div><div class='line' id='LC11628'>her quaint and pretty surprise upon me:</div><div class='line' id='LC11629'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11630'>&quot;The name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved, here made</div><div class='line' id='LC11631'>holy, and the music of it will abide alway in our ears.

I hadn&#39;t an idea in the</div><div class='line' id='LC11635'>world; but it would have been cruel to confess it and spoil her</div><div class='line' id='LC11636'>pretty game; so I never let on, but said:</div><div class='line' id='LC11637'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11638'>&quot;Yes, I know, sweetheart--how dear and good it is of you, too!</div><div class='line' id='LC11639'>But I want to hear these lips of yours, which are also mine, utter</div><div class='line' id='LC11640'>it first--then its music will be perfect.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11641'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11642'>Pleased to the marrow, she murmured:</div><div class='line' id='LC11643'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11644'>&quot;HELLO-CENTRAL!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11645'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11646'>I didn&#39;t laugh--I am always thankful for that--but the strain</div><div class='line' id='LC11647'>ruptured every cartilage in me, and for weeks afterward I could</div><div class='line' id='LC11648'>hear my bones clack when I walked.  She never found out her mistake.</div><div class='line' id='LC11649'>The first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone</div><div class='line' id='LC11650'>she was surprised, and not pleased; but I told her I had given</div><div class='line' id='LC11651'>order for it: that henceforth and forever the telephone must</div><div class='line' id='LC11652'>always be invoked with that reverent formality, in perpetual honor</div><div class='line' id='LC11653'>and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake.  This</div><div class='line' id='LC11654'>was not true.  But it answered.</div><div class='line' id='LC11655'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11656'>Well, during two weeks and a half we watched by the crib, and in</div><div class='line' id='LC11657'>our deep solicitude we were unconscious of any world outside of</div><div class='line' id='LC11658'>that sick-room.  Then our reward came: the center of the universe</div><div class='line' id='LC11659'>turned the corner and began to mend.  Grateful?  It isn&#39;t the term.</div><div class='line' id='LC11660'>There _isn&#39;t_ any term for it.  You know that yourself, if you&#39;ve</div><div class='line' id='LC11661'>watched your child through the Valley of the Shadow and seen it</div><div class='line' id='LC11662'>come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one</div><div class='line' id='LC11663'>all-illuminating smile that you could cover with your hand.</div><div class='line' id='LC11664'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11665'>Why, we were back in this world in one instant!  Then we looked</div><div class='line' id='LC11666'>the same startled thought into each other&#39;s eyes at the same</div><div class='line' id='LC11667'>moment; more than two weeks gone, and that ship not back yet!</div><div class='line' id='LC11668'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11669'>In another minute I appeared in the presence of my train.  They</div><div class='line' id='LC11670'>had been steeped in troubled bodings all this time--their faces</div><div class='line' id='LC11671'>showed it.  I called an escort and we galloped five miles to a</div><div class='line' id='LC11672'>hilltop overlooking the sea.  Where was my great commerce that</div><div class='line' id='LC11673'>so lately had made these glistening expanses populous and beautiful</div><div class='line' id='LC11674'>with its white-winged flocks?  Vanished, every one!  Not a sail,</div><div class='line' id='LC11675'>from verge to verge, not a smoke-bank--just a dead and empty</div><div class='line' id='LC11676'>solitude, in place of all that brisk and breezy life.</div><div class='line' id='LC11677'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11678'>I went swiftly back, saying not a word to anybody.  I told Sandy</div><div class='line' id='LC11679'>this ghastly news.  We could imagine no explanation that would</div><div class='line' id='LC11680'>begin to explain.  Had there been an invasion? an earthquake?</div><div class='line' id='LC11681'>a pestilence?  Had the nation been swept out of existence?  But</div><div class='line' id='LC11682'>guessing was profitless.  I must go--at once.  I borrowed the king&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC11683'>navy--a &quot;ship&quot; no bigger than a steam launch--and was soon ready.</div><div class='line' id='LC11684'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11685'>The parting--ah, yes, that was hard.  As I was devouring the child</div><div class='line' id='LC11686'>with last kisses, it brisked up and jabbered out its vocabulary!</div><div class='line' id='LC11687'>--the first time in more than two weeks, and it made fools of us</div><div class='line' id='LC11688'>for joy.  The darling mispronunciations of childhood!--dear me,</div><div class='line' id='LC11689'>there&#39;s no music that can touch it; and how one grieves when it</div><div class='line' id='LC11690'>wastes away and dissolves into correctness, knowing it will never</div><div class='line' id='LC11691'>visit his bereaved ear again.  Well, how good it was to be able</div><div class='line' id='LC11692'>to carry that gracious memory away with me!</div><div class='line' id='LC11693'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11694'>I approached England the next morning, with the wide highway of</div><div class='line' id='LC11695'>salt water all to myself.  There were ships in the harbor, at</div><div class='line' id='LC11696'>Dover, but they were naked as to sails, and there was no sign</div><div class='line' id='LC11697'>of life about them.  It was Sunday; yet at Canterbury the streets</div><div class='line' id='LC11698'>were empty; strangest of all, there was not even a priest in sight,</div><div class='line' id='LC11699'>and no stroke of a bell fell upon my ear.  The mournfulness of</div><div class='line' id='LC11700'>death was everywhere.  I couldn&#39;t understand it.  At last, in</div><div class='line' id='LC11701'>the further edge of that town I saw a small funeral procession</div><div class='line' id='LC11702'>--just a family and a few friends following a coffin--no priest;</div><div class='line' id='LC11703'>a funeral without bell, book, or candle; there was a church there</div><div class='line' id='LC11704'>close at hand, but they passed it by weeping, and did not enter it;</div><div class='line' id='LC11705'>I glanced up at the belfry, and there hung the bell, shrouded in</div><div class='line' id='LC11706'>black, and its tongue tied back.  Now I knew!  Now I understood</div><div class='line' id='LC11707'>the stupendous calamity that had overtaken England.  Invasion?</div><div class='line' id='LC11708'>Invasion is a triviality to it.  It was the INTERDICT!</div><div class='line' id='LC11709'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11710'>I asked no questions; I didn&#39;t need to ask any.  The Church had</div><div class='line' id='LC11711'>struck; the thing for me to do was to get into a disguise, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11712'>go warily.  One of my servants gave me a suit of clothes, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11713'>when we were safe beyond the town I put them on, and from that time</div><div class='line' id='LC11714'>I traveled alone; I could not risk the embarrassment of company.</div><div class='line' id='LC11715'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11716'>A miserable journey.  A desolate silence everywhere.  Even in</div><div class='line' id='LC11717'>London itself.  Traffic had ceased; men did not talk or laugh, or</div><div class='line' id='LC11718'>go in groups, or even in couples; they moved aimlessly about, each</div><div class='line' id='LC11719'>man by himself, with his head down, and woe and terror at his heart.</div><div class='line' id='LC11720'>The Tower showed recent war-scars.  Verily, much had been happening.</div><div class='line' id='LC11721'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11722'>Of course, I meant to take the train for Camelot.  Train!  Why,</div><div class='line' id='LC11723'>the station was as vacant as a cavern.  I moved on.  The journey</div><div class='line' id='LC11724'>to Camelot was a repetition of what I had already seen.  The Monday</div><div class='line' id='LC11725'>and the Tuesday differed in no way from the Sunday.  I arrived</div><div class='line' id='LC11726'>far in the night.  From being the best electric-lighted town in</div><div class='line' id='LC11727'>the kingdom and the most like a recumbent sun of anything you ever</div><div class='line' id='LC11728'>saw, it was become simply a blot--a blot upon darkness--that is</div><div class='line' id='LC11729'>to say, it was darker and solider than the rest of the darkness,</div><div class='line' id='LC11730'>and so you could see it a little better; it made me feel as if</div><div class='line' id='LC11731'>maybe it was symbolical--a sort of sign that the Church was going to</div><div class='line' id='LC11732'>_keep_ the upper hand now, and snuff out all my beautiful civilization</div><div class='line' id='LC11733'>just like that.  I found no life stirring in the somber streets.</div><div class='line' id='LC11734'>I groped my way with a heavy heart.  The vast castle loomed black</div><div class='line' id='LC11735'>upon the hilltop, not a spark visible about it.  The drawbridge</div><div class='line' id='LC11736'>was down, the great gate stood wide, I entered without challenge,</div><div class='line' id='LC11737'>my own heels making the only sound I heard--and it was sepulchral</div><div class='line' id='LC11738'>enough, in those huge vacant courts.</div><div class='line' id='LC11739'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11740'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11741'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11742'>CHAPTER XLII</div><div class='line' id='LC11743'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11744'>WAR!</div><div class='line' id='LC11745'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11746'>I found Clarence alone in his quarters, drowned in melancholy;</div><div class='line' id='LC11747'>and in place of the electric light, he had reinstituted the ancient</div><div class='line' id='LC11748'>rag-lamp, and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains</div><div class='line' id='LC11749'>drawn tight.  He sprang up and rushed for me eagerly, saying:</div><div class='line' id='LC11750'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11751'>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11752'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11753'>He knew me as easily as if I hadn&#39;t been disguised at all.

When you left, three miles of the London,</div><div class='line' id='LC11784'>Canterbury and Dover were ready for the rails, and also ready and</div><div class='line' id='LC11785'>ripe for manipulation in the stock-market.  It was wildcat, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11786'>everybody knew it.  The stock was for sale at a give-away.  What</div><div class='line' id='LC11787'>does Sir Launcelot do, but--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11788'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11789'>&quot;Yes, I know; he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song;</div><div class='line' id='LC11790'>then he bought about twice as much more, deliverable upon call;</div><div class='line' id='LC11791'>and he was about to call when I left.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11792'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11793'>&quot;Very well, he did call.  The boys couldn&#39;t deliver.  Oh, he had</div><div class='line' id='LC11794'>them--and he just settled his grip and squeezed them.  They were</div><div class='line' id='LC11795'>laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock</div><div class='line' id='LC11796'>to him at 15 and 16 and along there that wasn&#39;t worth 10.  Well,</div><div class='line' id='LC11797'>when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths,</div><div class='line' id='LC11798'>they rested-up that side by shifting the laugh to the other side.</div><div class='line' id='LC11799'>That was when they compromised with the Invincible at 283!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11800'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11801'>&quot;Good land!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11802'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11803'>&quot;He skinned them alive, and they deserved it--anyway, the whole</div><div class='line' id='LC11804'>kingdom rejoiced.  Well, among the flayed were Sir Agravaine and</div><div class='line' id='LC11805'>Sir Mordred, nephews to the king.  End of the first act.  Act</div><div class='line' id='LC11806'>second, scene first, an apartment in Carlisle castle, where the</div><div class='line' id='LC11807'>court had gone for a few days&#39; hunting.  Persons present, the</div><div class='line' id='LC11808'>whole tribe of the king&#39;s nephews.  Mordred and Agravaine propose</div><div class='line' id='LC11809'>to call the guileless Arthur&#39;s attention to Guenever and Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC11810'>Launcelot.  Sir Gawaine, Sir Gareth, and Sir Gaheris will have</div><div class='line' id='LC11811'>nothing to do with it.  A dispute ensues, with loud talk; in the</div><div class='line' id='LC11812'>midst of it enter the king.  Mordred and Agravaine spring their</div><div class='line' id='LC11813'>devastating tale upon him.  _Tableau_.  A trap is laid for Launcelot,</div><div class='line' id='LC11814'>by the king&#39;s command, and Sir Launcelot walks into it.  He made</div><div class='line' id='LC11815'>it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses--to wit,</div><div class='line' id='LC11816'>Mordred, Agravaine, and twelve knights of lesser rank, for he</div><div class='line' id='LC11817'>killed every one of them but Mordred; but of course that couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC11818'>straighten matters between Launcelot and the king, and didn&#39;t.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11819'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11820'>&quot;Oh, dear, only one thing could result--I see that.  War, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11821'>the knights of the realm divided into a king&#39;s party and a</div><div class='line' id='LC11822'>Sir Launcelot&#39;s party.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11823'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11824'>&quot;Yes--that was the way of it.  The king sent the queen to the</div><div class='line' id='LC11825'>stake, proposing to purify her with fire.  Launcelot and his</div><div class='line' id='LC11826'>knights rescued her, and in doing it slew certain good old friends</div><div class='line' id='LC11827'>of yours and mine--in fact, some of the best we ever had; to wit,</div><div class='line' id='LC11828'>Sir Belias le Orgulous, Sir Segwarides, Sir Griflet le Fils de Dieu,</div><div class='line' id='LC11829'>Sir Brandiles, Sir Aglovale--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11830'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11831'>&quot;Oh, you tear out my heartstrings.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11832'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11833'>&quot;--wait, I&#39;m not done yet--Sir Tor, Sir Gauter, Sir Gillimer--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11834'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11835'>&quot;The very best man in my subordinate nine.

Their love for Launcelot was indestructible.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11852'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11853'>&quot;Well, it was an accident.  They were simply onlookers; they were</div><div class='line' id='LC11854'>unarmed, and were merely there to witness the queen&#39;s punishment.</div><div class='line' id='LC11855'>Sir Launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury,</div><div class='line' id='LC11856'>and he killed these without noticing who they were.  Here is an</div><div class='line' id='LC11857'>instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle; it&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC11858'>for sale on every news-stand.  There--the figures nearest the queen</div><div class='line' id='LC11859'>are Sir Launcelot with his sword up, and Sir Gareth gasping his</div><div class='line' id='LC11860'>latest breath.  You can catch the agony in the queen&#39;s face through</div><div class='line' id='LC11861'>the curling smoke.  It&#39;s a rattling battle-picture.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11862'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11863'>&quot;Indeed, it is.  We must take good care of it; its historical value</div><div class='line' id='LC11864'>is incalculable.  Go on.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11865'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11866'>&quot;Well, the rest of the tale is just war, pure and simple.  Launcelot</div><div class='line' id='LC11867'>retreated to his town and castle of Joyous Gard, and gathered</div><div class='line' id='LC11868'>there a great following of knights.  The king, with a great host,</div><div class='line' id='LC11869'>went there, and there was desperate fighting during several days,</div><div class='line' id='LC11870'>and, as a result, all the plain around was paved with corpses</div><div class='line' id='LC11871'>and cast-iron.  Then the Church patched up a peace between Arthur</div><div class='line' id='LC11872'>and Launcelot and the queen and everybody--everybody but Sir Gawaine.</div><div class='line' id='LC11873'>He was bitter about the slaying of his brothers, Gareth and Gaheris,</div><div class='line' id='LC11874'>and would not be appeased.  He notified Launcelot to get him</div><div class='line' id='LC11875'>thence, and make swift preparation, and look to be soon attacked.</div><div class='line' id='LC11876'>So Launcelot sailed to his Duchy of Guienne with his following, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11877'>Gawaine soon followed with an army, and he beguiled Arthur to go</div><div class='line' id='LC11878'>with him.  Arthur left the kingdom in Sir Mordred&#39;s hands until</div><div class='line' id='LC11879'>you should return--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11880'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11881'>&quot;Ah--a king&#39;s customary wisdom!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11882'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11883'>&quot;Yes.  Sir Mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship</div><div class='line' id='LC11884'>permanent.  He was going to marry Guenever, as a first move; but</div><div class='line' id='LC11885'>she fled and shut herself up in the Tower of London.  Mordred</div><div class='line' id='LC11886'>attacked; the Bishop of Canterbury dropped down on him with the</div><div class='line' id='LC11887'>Interdict.  The king returned; Mordred fought him at Dover, at</div><div class='line' id='LC11888'>Canterbury, and again at Barham Down.  Then there was talk of peace</div><div class='line' id='LC11889'>and a composition.  Terms, Mordred to have Cornwall and Kent during</div><div class='line' id='LC11890'>Arthur&#39;s life, and the whole kingdom afterward.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11891'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11892'>&quot;Well, upon my word!  My dream of a republic to _be_ a dream, and</div><div class='line' id='LC11893'>so remain.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11894'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11895'>&quot;Yes.  The two armies lay near Salisbury.  Gawaine--Gawaine&#39;s head</div><div class='line' id='LC11896'>is at Dover Castle, he fell in the fight there--Gawaine appeared to</div><div class='line' id='LC11897'>Arthur in a dream, at least his ghost did, and warned him to</div><div class='line' id='LC11898'>refrain from conflict for a month, let the delay cost what it might.</div><div class='line' id='LC11899'>But battle was precipitated by an accident.  Arthur had given</div><div class='line' id='LC11900'>order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over</div><div class='line' id='LC11901'>the proposed treaty with Mordred, sound the trumpet and fall on!</div><div class='line' id='LC11902'>for he had no confidence in Mordred.  Mordred had given a similar</div><div class='line' id='LC11903'>order to _his_ people.  Well, by and by an adder bit a knight&#39;s heel;</div><div class='line' id='LC11904'>the knight forgot all about the order, and made a slash at the</div><div class='line' id='LC11905'>adder with his sword.  Inside of half a minute those two prodigious</div><div class='line' id='LC11906'>hosts came together with a crash!  They butchered away all day.</div><div class='line' id='LC11907'>Then the king--however, we have started something fresh since</div><div class='line' id='LC11908'>you left--our paper has.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11909'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11910'>&quot;No?

I had war</div><div class='line' id='LC11918'>correspondents with both armies.  I will finish that battle by</div><div class='line' id='LC11919'>reading you what one of the boys says:</div><div class='line' id='LC11920'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11921'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#39;Then the king looked about him, and then was he</div><div class='line' id='LC11922'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ware of all his host and of all his good knights</div><div class='line' id='LC11923'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were left no more on live but two knights, that</div><div class='line' id='LC11924'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was Sir Lucan de Butlere, and his brother Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC11925'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedivere: and they were full sore wounded.  Jesu</div><div class='line' id='LC11926'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercy, said the king, where are all my noble</div><div class='line' id='LC11927'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knights becomen?  Alas that ever I should see this</div><div class='line' id='LC11928'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doleful day.  For now, said Arthur, I am come to</div><div class='line' id='LC11929'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine end.  But would to God that I wist where were</div><div class='line' id='LC11930'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all</div><div class='line' id='LC11931'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this mischief.  Then was King Arthur ware where Sir</div><div class='line' id='LC11932'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap</div><div class='line' id='LC11933'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of dead men.  Now give me my spear, said Arthur</div><div class='line' id='LC11934'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Sir Lucan, for yonder I have espied the</div><div class='line' id='LC11935'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;traitor that all this woe hath wrought.  Sir, let</div><div class='line' id='LC11936'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him be, said Sir Lucan, for he is unhappy; and if</div><div class='line' id='LC11937'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye pass this unhappy day, ye shall be right well</div><div class='line' id='LC11938'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revenged upon him.  Good lord, remember ye of your</div><div class='line' id='LC11939'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night&#39;s dream, and what the spirit of Sir Gawaine</div><div class='line' id='LC11940'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;told you this night, yet God of his great goodness</div><div class='line' id='LC11941'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath preserved you hitherto.  Therefore, for God&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC11942'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sake, my lord, leave off by this. For blessed be</div><div class='line' id='LC11943'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God ye have won the field: for here we be three</div><div class='line' id='LC11944'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on live, and with Sir Mordred is none on live.</div><div class='line' id='LC11945'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if ye leave off now, this wicked day of</div><div class='line' id='LC11946'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destiny is past.  Tide me death, betide me life,</div><div class='line' id='LC11947'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith the king, now I see him yonder alone, he</div><div class='line' id='LC11948'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall never escape mine hands, for at a better</div><div class='line' id='LC11949'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avail shall I never have him.  God speed you well,</div><div class='line' id='LC11950'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said Sir Bedivere.  Then the king gat his spear</div><div class='line' id='LC11951'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in both his hands, and ran toward Sir Mordred</div><div class='line' id='LC11952'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crying, Traitor, now is thy death day come.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC11953'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when Sir Mordred heard Sir Arthur, he ran until</div><div class='line' id='LC11954'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him with his sword drawn in his hand.  And then</div><div class='line' id='LC11955'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield,</div><div class='line' id='LC11956'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a foin of his spear throughout the body more</div><div class='line' id='LC11957'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a fathom.  And when Sir Mordred felt that he</div><div class='line' id='LC11958'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had his death&#39;s wound, he thrust himself, with</div><div class='line' id='LC11959'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the might that he had, up to the butt of King</div><div class='line' id='LC11960'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur&#39;s spear.  And right so he smote his father</div><div class='line' id='LC11961'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands,</div><div class='line' id='LC11962'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the side of the head, that the sword pierced</div><div class='line' id='LC11963'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the helmet and the brain-pan, and therewithal</div><div class='line' id='LC11964'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth.  And</div><div class='line' id='LC11965'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth,</div><div class='line' id='LC11966'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there he swooned oft-times--&#39;&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC11967'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC11968'>&quot;That is a good piece of war correspondence, Clarence; you are</div><div class='line' id='LC11969'>a first-rate newspaper man.

Smart as</div><div class='line' id='LC12026'>you are, the Church was smarter.  It was the Church that sent</div><div class='line' id='LC12027'>you cruising--through her servants, the doctors.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12028'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12029'>&quot;Clarence!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12030'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12031'>&quot;It is the truth.  I know it.  Every officer of your ship was</div><div class='line' id='LC12032'>the Church&#39;s picked servant, and so was every man of the crew.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12033'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12034'>&quot;Oh, come!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12035'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12036'>&quot;It is just as I tell you.  I did not find out these things at once,</div><div class='line' id='LC12037'>but I found them out finally.  Did you send me verbal information,</div><div class='line' id='LC12038'>by the commander of the ship, to the effect that upon his return</div><div class='line' id='LC12039'>to you, with supplies, you were going to leave Cadiz--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12040'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12041'>&quot;Cadiz!  I haven&#39;t been at Cadiz at all!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12042'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12043'>&quot;--going to leave Cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely,</div><div class='line' id='LC12044'>for the health of your family?  Did you send me that word?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12045'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12046'>&quot;Of course not.  I would have written, wouldn&#39;t I?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12047'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12048'>&quot;Naturally.  I was troubled and suspicious.  When the commander</div><div class='line' id='LC12049'>sailed again I managed to ship a spy with him.  I have never</div><div class='line' id='LC12050'>heard of vessel or spy since.  I gave myself two weeks to hear</div><div class='line' id='LC12051'>from you in.  Then I resolved to send a ship to Cadiz.  There was</div><div class='line' id='LC12052'>a reason why I didn&#39;t.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12053'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12054'>&quot;What was that?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12055'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12056'>&quot;Our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared!  Also, as</div><div class='line' id='LC12057'>suddenly and as mysteriously, the railway and telegraph and</div><div class='line' id='LC12058'>telephone service ceased, the men all deserted, poles were cut</div><div class='line' id='LC12059'>down, the Church laid a ban upon the electric light!  I had to be</div><div class='line' id='LC12060'>up and doing--and straight off.  Your life was safe--nobody in</div><div class='line' id='LC12061'>these kingdoms but Merlin would venture to touch such a magician</div><div class='line' id='LC12062'>as you without ten thousand men at his back--I had nothing to</div><div class='line' id='LC12063'>think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your</div><div class='line' id='LC12064'>coming.  I felt safe myself--nobody would be anxious to touch</div><div class='line' id='LC12065'>a pet of yours.  So this is what I did.  From our various works</div><div class='line' id='LC12066'>I selected all the men--boys I mean--whose faithfulness under</div><div class='line' id='LC12067'>whatsoever pressure I could swear to, and I called them together</div><div class='line' id='LC12068'>secretly and gave them their instructions.  There are fifty-two of</div><div class='line' id='LC12069'>them; none younger than fourteen, and none above seventeen years old.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12070'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12071'>&quot;Why did you select boys?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12072'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12073'>&quot;Because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition</div><div class='line' id='LC12074'>and reared in it.  It is in their blood and bones.  We imagined</div><div class='line' id='LC12075'>we had educated it out of them; they thought so, too; the Interdict</div><div class='line' id='LC12076'>woke them up like a thunderclap!  It revealed them to themselves,</div><div class='line' id='LC12077'>and it revealed them to me, too.  With boys it was different.  Such</div><div class='line' id='LC12078'>as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had</div><div class='line' id='LC12079'>no acquaintance with the Church&#39;s terrors, and it was among these</div><div class='line' id='LC12080'>that I found my fifty-two.  As a next move, I paid a private visit</div><div class='line' id='LC12081'>to that old cave of Merlin&#39;s--not the small one--the big one--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12082'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12083'>&quot;Yes, the one where we secretly established our first great electric</div><div class='line' id='LC12084'>plant when I was projecting a miracle.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12085'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12086'>&quot;Just so.  And as that miracle hadn&#39;t become necessary then,</div><div class='line' id='LC12087'>I thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now.  I&#39;ve</div><div class='line' id='LC12088'>provisioned the cave for a siege--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12089'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12090'>&quot;A good idea, a first-rate idea.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12091'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12092'>&quot;I think so.  I placed four of my boys there as a guard--inside,</div><div class='line' id='LC12093'>and out of sight.  Nobody was to be hurt--while outside; but any</div><div class='line' id='LC12094'>attempt to enter--well, we said just let anybody try it!  Then</div><div class='line' id='LC12095'>I went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires</div><div class='line' id='LC12096'>which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite</div><div class='line' id='LC12097'>deposits under all our vast factories, mills, workshops, magazines,</div><div class='line' id='LC12098'>etc., and about midnight I and my boys turned out and connected</div><div class='line' id='LC12099'>that wire with the cave, and nobody but you and I suspects where</div><div class='line' id='LC12100'>the other end of it goes to.  We laid it under ground, of course, and</div><div class='line' id='LC12101'>it was all finished in a couple of hours or so.  We sha&#39;n&#39;t have</div><div class='line' id='LC12102'>to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12103'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12104'>&quot;It was the right move--and the natural one; military necessity,</div><div class='line' id='LC12105'>in the changed condition of things.  Well, what changes _have_ come!</div><div class='line' id='LC12106'>We expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other, but</div><div class='line' id='LC12107'>--however, go on.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12108'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12109'>&quot;Next, we built a wire fence.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12110'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12111'>&quot;Wire fence?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12112'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12113'>&quot;Yes.  You dropped the hint of it yourself, two or three years ago.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12114'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12115'>&quot;Oh, I remember--the time the Church tried her strength against</div><div class='line' id='LC12116'>us the first time, and presently thought it wise to wait for a</div><div class='line' id='LC12117'>hopefuler season.  Well, how have you arranged the fence?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12118'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12119'>&quot;I start twelve immensely strong wires--naked, not insulated</div><div class='line' id='LC12120'>--from a big dynamo in the cave--dynamo with no brushes except</div><div class='line' id='LC12121'>a positive and a negative one--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12122'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12123'>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12124'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12125'>&quot;The wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level</div><div class='line' id='LC12126'>ground a hundred yards in diameter; they make twelve independent</div><div class='line' id='LC12127'>fences, ten feet apart--that is to say, twelve circles within</div><div class='line' id='LC12128'>circles--and their ends come into the cave again.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12129'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12130'>&quot;Right; go on.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12131'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12132'>&quot;The fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart,</div><div class='line' id='LC12133'>and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12134'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12135'>&quot;That is good and strong.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12136'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12137'>&quot;Yes.  The wires have no ground-connection outside of the cave.</div><div class='line' id='LC12138'>They go out from the positive brush of the dynamo; there is a</div><div class='line' id='LC12139'>ground-connection through the negative brush; the other ends of</div><div class='line' id='LC12140'>the wire return to the cave, and each is grounded independently.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12141'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12142'>&quot;No, no, that won&#39;t do!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12143'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12144'>&quot;Why?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12145'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12146'>&quot;It&#39;s too expensive--uses up force for nothing.  You don&#39;t want</div><div class='line' id='LC12147'>any ground-connection except the one through the negative brush.</div><div class='line' id='LC12148'>The other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave</div><div class='line' id='LC12149'>and fastened independently, and _without_ any ground-connection.</div><div class='line' id='LC12150'>Now, then, observe the economy of it.  A cavalry charge hurls</div><div class='line' id='LC12151'>itself against the fence; you are using no power, you are spending</div><div class='line' id='LC12152'>no money, for there is only one ground-connection till those horses</div><div class='line' id='LC12153'>come against the wire; the moment they touch it they form a</div><div class='line' id='LC12154'>connection with the negative brush _through the ground_, and drop</div><div class='line' id='LC12155'>dead.  Don&#39;t you see?--you are using no energy until it is needed;</div><div class='line' id='LC12156'>your lightning is there, and ready, like the load in a gun; but</div><div class='line' id='LC12157'>it isn&#39;t costing you a cent till you touch it off.  Oh, yes, the</div><div class='line' id='LC12158'>single ground-connection--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12159'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12160'>&quot;Of course!  I don&#39;t know how I overlooked that.  It&#39;s not only</div><div class='line' id='LC12161'>cheaper, but it&#39;s more effectual than the other way, for if wires</div><div class='line' id='LC12162'>break or get tangled, no harm is done.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12163'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12164'>&quot;No, especially if we have a tell-tale in the cave and disconnect</div><div class='line' id='LC12165'>the broken wire.  Well, go on.  The gatlings?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12166'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12167'>&quot;Yes--that&#39;s arranged.  In the center of the inner circle, on a</div><div class='line' id='LC12168'>spacious platform six feet high, I&#39;ve grouped a battery of thirteen</div><div class='line' id='LC12169'>gatling guns, and provided plenty of ammunition.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12170'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12171'>&quot;That&#39;s it.  They command every approach, and when the Church&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC12172'>knights arrive, there&#39;s going to be music.  The brow of the</div><div class='line' id='LC12173'>precipice over the cave--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12174'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12175'>&quot;I&#39;ve got a wire fence there, and a gatling.  They won&#39;t drop any</div><div class='line' id='LC12176'>rocks down on us.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12177'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12178'>&quot;Well, and the glass-cylinder dynamite torpedoes?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12179'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12180'>&quot;That&#39;s attended to.  It&#39;s the prettiest garden that was ever</div><div class='line' id='LC12181'>planted.  It&#39;s a belt forty feet wide, and goes around the outer</div><div class='line' id='LC12182'>fence--distance between it and the fence one hundred yards--kind of</div><div class='line' id='LC12183'>neutral ground that space is.  There isn&#39;t a single square yard</div><div class='line' id='LC12184'>of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo.  We laid them</div><div class='line' id='LC12185'>on the surface of the ground, and sprinkled a layer of sand over</div><div class='line' id='LC12186'>them.  It&#39;s an innocent looking garden, but you let a man start</div><div class='line' id='LC12187'>in to hoe it once, and you&#39;ll see.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12188'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12189'>&quot;You tested the torpedoes?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12190'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12191'>&quot;Well, I was going to, but--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12192'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12193'>&quot;But what?  Why, it&#39;s an immense oversight not to apply a--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12194'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12195'>&quot;Test?  Yes, I know; but they&#39;re all right; I laid a few in the</div><div class='line' id='LC12196'>public road beyond our lines and they&#39;ve been tested.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12197'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12198'>&quot;Oh, that alters the case.  Who did it?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12199'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12200'>&quot;A Church committee.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12201'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12202'>&quot;How kind!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12203'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12204'>&quot;Yes.  They came to command us to make submission.  You see they</div><div class='line' id='LC12205'>didn&#39;t really come to test the torpedoes; that was merely an incident.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12206'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12207'>&quot;Did the committee make a report?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12208'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12209'>&quot;Yes, they made one.

After that I put up some signs, for the</div><div class='line' id='LC12214'>protection of future committees, and we have had no intruders since.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12215'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12216'>&quot;Clarence, you&#39;ve done a world of work, and done it perfectly.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12217'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12218'>&quot;We had plenty of time for it; there wasn&#39;t any occasion for hurry.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12219'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12220'>We sat silent awhile, thinking.

At dawn I sent</div><div class='line' id='LC12291'>an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop</div><div class='line' id='LC12292'>operations and remove all life to a safe distance, as everything</div><div class='line' id='LC12293'>was going to be blown up by secret mines, &quot;_and no telling at what</div><div class='line' id='LC12294'>moment--therefore, vacate at once_.&quot;  These people knew me, and</div><div class='line' id='LC12295'>had confidence in my word.  They would clear out without waiting</div><div class='line' id='LC12296'>to part their hair, and I could take my own time about dating the</div><div class='line' id='LC12297'>explosion.

It was not dull for me, because I was</div><div class='line' id='LC12301'>writing all the time.  During the first three days, I finished</div><div class='line' id='LC12302'>turning my old diary into this narrative form; it only required</div><div class='line' id='LC12303'>a chapter or so to bring it down to date.  The rest of the week</div><div class='line' id='LC12304'>I took up in writing letters to my wife.

Every report</div><div class='line' id='LC12322'>made things look more and more impressive.  The hosts were gathering,</div><div class='line' id='LC12323'>gathering; down all the roads and paths of England the knights were</div><div class='line' id='LC12324'>riding, and priests rode with them, to hearten these original</div><div class='line' id='LC12325'>Crusaders, this being the Church&#39;s war.  All the nobilities, big</div><div class='line' id='LC12326'>and little, were on their way, and all the gentry.  This was all</div><div class='line' id='LC12327'>as was expected.  We should thin out this sort of folk to such</div><div class='line' id='LC12328'>a degree that the people would have nothing to do but just step</div><div class='line' id='LC12329'>to the front with their republic and--</div><div class='line' id='LC12330'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12331'>Ah, what a donkey I was!  Toward the end of the week I began to get</div><div class='line' id='LC12332'>this large and disenchanting fact through my head: that the mass</div><div class='line' id='LC12333'>of the nation had swung their caps and shouted for the republic for</div><div class='line' id='LC12334'>about one day, and there an end!  The Church, the nobles, and</div><div class='line' id='LC12335'>the gentry then turned one grand, all-disapproving frown upon them</div><div class='line' id='LC12336'>and shriveled them into sheep!  From that moment the sheep had</div><div class='line' id='LC12337'>begun to gather to the fold--that is to say, the camps--and offer</div><div class='line' id='LC12338'>their valueless lives and their valuable wool to the &quot;righteous</div><div class='line' id='LC12339'>cause.&quot;  Why, even the very men who had lately been slaves were</div><div class='line' id='LC12340'>in the &quot;righteous cause,&quot; and glorifying it, praying for it,</div><div class='line' id='LC12341'>sentimentally slabbering over it, just like all the other commoners.</div><div class='line' id='LC12342'>Imagine such human muck as this; conceive of this folly!</div><div class='line' id='LC12343'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12344'>Yes, it was now &quot;Death to the Republic!&quot; everywhere--not a dissenting</div><div class='line' id='LC12345'>voice.

I knew</div><div class='line' id='LC12352'>that that thought would keep saying itself over and over again</div><div class='line' id='LC12353'>in their minds and hearts, _All England is marching against us!_</div><div class='line' id='LC12354'>and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition,</div><div class='line' id='LC12355'>ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations, until</div><div class='line' id='LC12356'>even in their sleep they would find no rest from it, but hear</div><div class='line' id='LC12357'>the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say, _All England_</div><div class='line' id='LC12358'>--ALL ENGLAND!--_is marching against you_!  I knew all this would</div><div class='line' id='LC12359'>happen; I knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great</div><div class='line' id='LC12360'>that it would compel utterance; therefore, I must be ready with an</div><div class='line' id='LC12361'>answer at that time--an answer well chosen and tranquilizing.</div><div class='line' id='LC12362'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12363'>I was right.  The time came.  They HAD to speak.  Poor lads, it</div><div class='line' id='LC12364'>was pitiful to see, they were so pale, so worn, so troubled.  At</div><div class='line' id='LC12365'>first their spokesman could hardly find voice or words; but he</div><div class='line' id='LC12366'>presently got both.  This is what he said--and he put it in the</div><div class='line' id='LC12367'>neat modern English taught him in my schools:</div><div class='line' id='LC12368'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12369'>&quot;We have tried to forget what we are--English boys!  We have tried</div><div class='line' id='LC12370'>to put reason before sentiment, duty before love; our minds</div><div class='line' id='LC12371'>approve, but our hearts reproach us.  While apparently it was</div><div class='line' id='LC12372'>only the nobility, only the gentry, only the twenty-five or thirty</div><div class='line' id='LC12373'>thousand knights left alive out of the late wars, we were of one</div><div class='line' id='LC12374'>mind, and undisturbed by any troubling doubt; each and every one</div><div class='line' id='LC12375'>of these fifty-two lads who stand here before you, said, &#39;They</div><div class='line' id='LC12376'>have chosen--it is their affair.&#39;  But think!--the matter is</div><div class='line' id='LC12377'>altered--_All England is marching against us_!  Oh, sir, consider!</div><div class='line' id='LC12378'>--reflect!--these people are our people, they are bone of our bone,</div><div class='line' id='LC12379'>flesh of our flesh, we love them--do not ask us to destroy our nation!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12380'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12381'>Well, it shows the value of looking ahead, and being ready for</div><div class='line' id='LC12382'>a thing when it happens.  If I hadn&#39;t foreseen this thing and been</div><div class='line' id='LC12383'>fixed, that boy would have had me!--I couldn&#39;t have said a word.</div><div class='line' id='LC12384'>But I was fixed.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC12385'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12386'>&quot;My boys, your hearts are in the right place, you have thought the</div><div class='line' id='LC12387'>worthy thought, you have done the worthy thing.  You are English</div><div class='line' id='LC12388'>boys, you will remain English boys, and you will keep that name</div><div class='line' id='LC12389'>unsmirched.  Give yourselves no further concern, let your minds be</div><div class='line' id='LC12390'>at peace.  Consider this: while all England is marching against</div><div class='line' id='LC12391'>us, who is in the van?  Who, by the commonest rules of war, will</div><div class='line' id='LC12392'>march in the front?  Answer me.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12393'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12394'>&quot;The mounted host of mailed knights.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12395'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12396'>&quot;True.  They are thirty thousand strong.  Acres deep they will march.</div><div class='line' id='LC12397'>Now, observe: none but _they_ will ever strike the sand-belt!  Then</div><div class='line' id='LC12398'>there will be an episode!

It is absolutely</div><div class='line' id='LC12402'>true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand</div><div class='line' id='LC12403'>knights.  Now speak, and it shall be as you decide.  Shall we</div><div class='line' id='LC12404'>avoid the battle, retire from the field?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12405'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12406'>&quot;NO!!!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12407'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12408'>The shout was unanimous and hearty.</div><div class='line' id='LC12409'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12410'>&quot;Are you--are you--well, afraid of these thirty thousand knights?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12411'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12412'>That joke brought out a good laugh, the boys&#39; troubles vanished</div><div class='line' id='LC12413'>away, and they went gaily to their posts.  Ah, they were a darling</div><div class='line' id='LC12414'>fifty-two!  As pretty as girls, too.</div><div class='line' id='LC12415'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12416'>I was ready for the enemy now.  Let the approaching big day come</div><div class='line' id='LC12417'>along--it would find us on deck.</div><div class='line' id='LC12418'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12419'>The big day arrived on time.  At dawn the sentry on watch in the</div><div class='line' id='LC12420'>corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under</div><div class='line' id='LC12421'>the horizon, and a faint sound which he thought to be military</div><div class='line' id='LC12422'>music.  Breakfast was just ready; we sat down and ate it.</div><div class='line' id='LC12423'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12424'>This over, I made the boys a little speech, and then sent out</div><div class='line' id='LC12425'>a detail to man the battery, with Clarence in command of it.</div><div class='line' id='LC12426'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12427'>The sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over</div><div class='line' id='LC12428'>the land, and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us,</div><div class='line' id='LC12429'>with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea.</div><div class='line' id='LC12430'>Nearer and nearer it came, and more and more sublimely imposing</div><div class='line' id='LC12431'>became its aspect; yes, all England was there, apparently.  Soon</div><div class='line' id='LC12432'>we could see the innumerable banners fluttering, and then the sun</div><div class='line' id='LC12433'>struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash.  Yes, it was a fine</div><div class='line' id='LC12434'>sight; I hadn&#39;t ever seen anything to beat it.</div><div class='line' id='LC12435'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12436'>At last we could make out details.  All the front ranks, no telling</div><div class='line' id='LC12437'>how many acres deep, were horsemen--plumed knights in armor.</div><div class='line' id='LC12438'>Suddenly we heard the blare of trumpets; the slow walk burst into</div><div class='line' id='LC12439'>a gallop, and then--well, it was wonderful to see!  Down swept</div><div class='line' id='LC12440'>that vast horse-shoe wave--it approached the sand-belt--my breath</div><div class='line' id='LC12441'>stood still; nearer, nearer--the strip of green turf beyond the</div><div class='line' id='LC12442'>yellow belt grew narrow--narrower still--became a mere ribbon in</div><div class='line' id='LC12443'>front of the horses--then disappeared under their hoofs.  Great</div><div class='line' id='LC12444'>Scott!  Why, the whole front of that host shot into the sky with</div><div class='line' id='LC12445'>a thunder-crash, and became a whirling tempest of rags and fragments;</div><div class='line' id='LC12446'>and along the ground lay a thick wall of smoke that hid what was</div><div class='line' id='LC12447'>left of the multitude from our sight.</div><div class='line' id='LC12448'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12449'>Time for the second step in the plan of campaign!  I touched</div><div class='line' id='LC12450'>a button, and shook the bones of England loose from her spine!</div><div class='line' id='LC12451'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12452'>In that explosion all our noble civilization-factories went up in</div><div class='line' id='LC12453'>the air and disappeared from the earth.  It was a pity, but it</div><div class='line' id='LC12454'>was necessary.  We could not afford to let the enemy turn our own</div><div class='line' id='LC12455'>weapons against us.</div><div class='line' id='LC12456'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12457'>Now ensued one of the dullest quarter-hours I had ever endured.</div><div class='line' id='LC12458'>We waited in a silent solitude enclosed by our circles of wire,</div><div class='line' id='LC12459'>and by a circle of heavy smoke outside of these.  We couldn&#39;t</div><div class='line' id='LC12460'>see over the wall of smoke, and we couldn&#39;t see through it.  But</div><div class='line' id='LC12461'>at last it began to shred away lazily, and by the end of another</div><div class='line' id='LC12462'>quarter-hour the land was clear and our curiosity was enabled</div><div class='line' id='LC12463'>to satisfy itself.  No living creature was in sight!  We now</div><div class='line' id='LC12464'>perceived that additions had been made to our defenses.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC12465'>dynamite had dug a ditch more than a hundred feet wide, all around</div><div class='line' id='LC12466'>us, and cast up an embankment some twenty-five feet high on both</div><div class='line' id='LC12467'>borders of it.  As to destruction of life, it was amazing.  Moreover,</div><div class='line' id='LC12468'>it was beyond estimate.  Of course, we could not _count_ the dead,</div><div class='line' id='LC12469'>because they did not exist as individuals, but merely as homogeneous</div><div class='line' id='LC12470'>protoplasm, with alloys of iron and buttons.</div><div class='line' id='LC12471'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12472'>No life was in sight, but necessarily there must have been some</div><div class='line' id='LC12473'>wounded in the rear ranks, who were carried off the field under</div><div class='line' id='LC12474'>cover of the wall of smoke; there would be sickness among the</div><div class='line' id='LC12475'>others--there always is, after an episode like that.  But there</div><div class='line' id='LC12476'>would be no reinforcements; this was the last stand of the chivalry</div><div class='line' id='LC12477'>of England; it was all that was left of the order, after the recent</div><div class='line' id='LC12478'>annihilating wars.  So I felt quite safe in believing that the</div><div class='line' id='LC12479'>utmost force that could for the future be brought against us</div><div class='line' id='LC12480'>would be but small; that is, of knights.  I therefore issued a</div><div class='line' id='LC12481'>congratulatory proclamation to my army in these words:</div><div class='line' id='LC12482'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12483'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOLDIERS, CHAMPIONS OF HUMAN LIBERTY AND EQUALITY:</div><div class='line' id='LC12484'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your General congratulates you!  In the pride of his</div><div class='line' id='LC12485'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strength and the vanity of his renown, an arrogant</div><div class='line' id='LC12486'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemy came against you.  You were ready.  The conflict</div><div class='line' id='LC12487'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was brief; on your side, glorious.  This mighty</div><div class='line' id='LC12488'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;victory, having been achieved utterly without loss,</div><div class='line' id='LC12489'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stands without example in history.  So long as the</div><div class='line' id='LC12490'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planets shall continue to move in their orbits, the</div><div class='line' id='LC12491'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BATTLE OF THE SAND-BELT will not perish out of the</div><div class='line' id='LC12492'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memories of men.</div><div class='line' id='LC12493'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12494'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BOSS.</div><div class='line' id='LC12495'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12496'>I read it well, and the applause I got was very gratifying to me.</div><div class='line' id='LC12497'>I then wound up with these remarks:</div><div class='line' id='LC12498'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12499'>&quot;The war with the English nation, as a nation, is at an end.</div><div class='line' id='LC12500'>The nation has retired from the field and the war.  Before it can</div><div class='line' id='LC12501'>be persuaded to return, war will have ceased.  This campaign is</div><div class='line' id='LC12502'>the only one that is going to be fought.  It will be brief</div><div class='line' id='LC12503'>--the briefest in history.  Also the most destructive to life,</div><div class='line' id='LC12504'>considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to</div><div class='line' id='LC12505'>numbers engaged.  We are done with the nation; henceforth we deal</div><div class='line' id='LC12506'>only with the knights.  English knights can be killed, but they</div><div class='line' id='LC12507'>cannot be conquered.  We know what is before us.  While one of</div><div class='line' id='LC12508'>these men remains alive, our task is not finished, the war is not</div><div class='line' id='LC12509'>ended.  We will kill them all.&quot;  [Loud and long continued applause.]</div><div class='line' id='LC12510'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12511'>I picketed the great embankments thrown up around our lines by</div><div class='line' id='LC12512'>the dynamite explosion--merely a lookout of a couple of boys</div><div class='line' id='LC12513'>to announce the enemy when he should appear again.</div><div class='line' id='LC12514'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12515'>Next, I sent an engineer and forty men to a point just beyond</div><div class='line' id='LC12516'>our lines on the south, to turn a mountain brook that was there,</div><div class='line' id='LC12517'>and bring it within our lines and under our command, arranging</div><div class='line' id='LC12518'>it in such a way that I could make instant use of it in an emergency.</div><div class='line' id='LC12519'>The forty men were divided into two shifts of twenty each, and</div><div class='line' id='LC12520'>were to relieve each other every two hours.  In ten hours the</div><div class='line' id='LC12521'>work was accomplished.</div><div class='line' id='LC12522'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12523'>It was nightfall now, and I withdrew my pickets.  The one who</div><div class='line' id='LC12524'>had had the northern outlook reported a camp in sight, but visible</div><div class='line' id='LC12525'>with the glass only.  He also reported that a few knights had been</div><div class='line' id='LC12526'>feeling their way toward us, and had driven some cattle across our</div><div class='line' id='LC12527'>lines, but that the knights themselves had not come very near.</div><div class='line' id='LC12528'>That was what I had been expecting.  They were feeling us, you</div><div class='line' id='LC12529'>see; they wanted to know if we were going to play that red terror</div><div class='line' id='LC12530'>on them again.  They would grow bolder in the night, perhaps.</div><div class='line' id='LC12531'>I believed I knew what project they would attempt, because it was</div><div class='line' id='LC12532'>plainly the thing I would attempt myself if I were in their places</div><div class='line' id='LC12533'>and as ignorant as they were.  I mentioned it to Clarence.</div><div class='line' id='LC12534'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12535'>&quot;I think you are right,&quot; said he; &quot;it is the obvious thing for</div><div class='line' id='LC12536'>them to try.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12537'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12538'>&quot;Well, then,&quot; I said, &quot;if they do it they are doomed.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12539'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12540'>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12541'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12542'>&quot;They won&#39;t have the slightest show in the world.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12543'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12544'>&quot;Of course they won&#39;t.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12545'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12546'>&quot;It&#39;s dreadful, Clarence.  It seems an awful pity.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12547'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12548'>The thing disturbed me so that I couldn&#39;t get any peace of mind</div><div class='line' id='LC12549'>for thinking of it and worrying over it.  So, at last, to quiet</div><div class='line' id='LC12550'>my conscience, I framed this message to the knights:</div><div class='line' id='LC12551'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12552'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO THE HONORABLE THE COMMANDER OF THE INSURGENT</div><div class='line' id='LC12553'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHIVALRY OF ENGLAND: YOU fight in vain.

He laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with, and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC12574'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12575'>&quot;Somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what</div><div class='line' id='LC12576'>these nobilities are.  Now let us save a little time and trouble.</div><div class='line' id='LC12577'>Consider me the commander of the knights yonder.  Now, then,</div><div class='line' id='LC12578'>you are the flag of truce; approach and deliver me your message,</div><div class='line' id='LC12579'>and I will give you your answer.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12580'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12581'>I humored the idea.  I came forward under an imaginary guard of</div><div class='line' id='LC12582'>the enemy&#39;s soldiers, produced my paper, and read it through.</div><div class='line' id='LC12583'>For answer, Clarence struck the paper out of my hand, pursed up</div><div class='line' id='LC12584'>a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain:</div><div class='line' id='LC12585'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12586'>&quot;Dismember me this animal, and return him in a basket to the</div><div class='line' id='LC12587'>base-born knave who sent him; other answer have I none!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12588'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12589'>How empty is theory in presence of fact!  And this was just fact,</div><div class='line' id='LC12590'>and nothing else.  It was the thing that would have happened,</div><div class='line' id='LC12591'>there was no getting around that.  I tore up the paper and granted</div><div class='line' id='LC12592'>my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest.</div><div class='line' id='LC12593'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12594'>Then, to business.  I tested the electric signals from the gatling</div><div class='line' id='LC12595'>platform to the cave, and made sure that they were all right;</div><div class='line' id='LC12596'>I tested and retested those which commanded the fences--these</div><div class='line' id='LC12597'>were signals whereby I could break and renew the electric current</div><div class='line' id='LC12598'>in each fence independently of the others at will.  I placed the</div><div class='line' id='LC12599'>brook-connection under the guard and authority of three of my</div><div class='line' id='LC12600'>best boys, who would alternate in two-hour watches all night and</div><div class='line' id='LC12601'>promptly obey my signal, if I should have occasion to give it</div><div class='line' id='LC12602'>--three revolver-shots in quick succession.  Sentry-duty was discarded</div><div class='line' id='LC12603'>for the night, and the corral left empty of life; I ordered that</div><div class='line' id='LC12604'>quiet be maintained in the cave, and the electric lights turned</div><div class='line' id='LC12605'>down to a glimmer.</div><div class='line' id='LC12606'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12607'>As soon as it was good and dark, I shut off the current from all</div><div class='line' id='LC12608'>the fences, and then groped my way out to the embankment bordering</div><div class='line' id='LC12609'>our side of the great dynamite ditch.  I crept to the top of it</div><div class='line' id='LC12610'>and lay there on the slant of the muck to watch.  But it was</div><div class='line' id='LC12611'>too dark to see anything.  As for sounds, there were none.  The</div><div class='line' id='LC12612'>stillness was deathlike.  True, there were the usual night-sounds</div><div class='line' id='LC12613'>of the country--the whir of night-birds, the buzzing of insects,</div><div class='line' id='LC12614'>the barking of distant dogs, the mellow lowing of far-off kine</div><div class='line' id='LC12615'>--but these didn&#39;t seem to break the stillness, they only intensified</div><div class='line' id='LC12616'>it, and added a grewsome melancholy to it into the bargain.</div><div class='line' id='LC12617'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12618'>I presently gave up looking, the night shut down so black, but</div><div class='line' id='LC12619'>I kept my ears strained to catch the least suspicious sound, for</div><div class='line' id='LC12620'>I judged I had only to wait, and I shouldn&#39;t be disappointed.</div><div class='line' id='LC12621'>However, I had to wait a long time.  At last I caught what you</div><div class='line' id='LC12622'>may call in distinct glimpses of sound dulled metallic sound.</div><div class='line' id='LC12623'>I pricked up my ears, then, and held my breath, for this was the</div><div class='line' id='LC12624'>sort of thing I had been waiting for.  This sound thickened, and</div><div class='line' id='LC12625'>approached--from toward the north.  Presently, I heard it at my</div><div class='line' id='LC12626'>own level--the ridge-top of the opposite embankment, a hundred</div><div class='line' id='LC12627'>feet or more away.  Then I seemed to see a row of black dots appear</div><div class='line' id='LC12628'>along that ridge--human heads?  I couldn&#39;t tell; it mightn&#39;t be</div><div class='line' id='LC12629'>anything at all; you can&#39;t depend on your eyes when your imagination</div><div class='line' id='LC12630'>is out of focus.  However, the question was soon settled.  I heard</div><div class='line' id='LC12631'>that metallic noise descending into the great ditch.  It augmented</div><div class='line' id='LC12632'>fast, it spread all along, and it unmistakably furnished me this</div><div class='line' id='LC12633'>fact: an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch.  Yes,</div><div class='line' id='LC12634'>these people were arranging a little surprise party for us.  We</div><div class='line' id='LC12635'>could expect entertainment about dawn, possibly earlier.</div><div class='line' id='LC12636'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12637'>I groped my way back to the corral now; I had seen enough.  I went</div><div class='line' id='LC12638'>to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two</div><div class='line' id='LC12639'>inner fences.  Then I went into the cave, and found everything</div><div class='line' id='LC12640'>satisfactory there--nobody awake but the working-watch.  I woke</div><div class='line' id='LC12641'>Clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men,</div><div class='line' id='LC12642'>and that I believed all the knights were coming for us in a body.</div><div class='line' id='LC12643'>It was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect</div><div class='line' id='LC12644'>the ditch&#39;s ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment</div><div class='line' id='LC12645'>and make an assault, and be followed immediately by the rest</div><div class='line' id='LC12646'>of their army.</div><div class='line' id='LC12647'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12648'>Clarence said:</div><div class='line' id='LC12649'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12650'>&quot;They will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make</div><div class='line' id='LC12651'>preliminary observations.  Why not take the lightning off the</div><div class='line' id='LC12652'>outer fences, and give them a chance?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12653'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12654'>&quot;I&#39;ve already done it, Clarence.  Did you ever know me to be</div><div class='line' id='LC12655'>inhospitable?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12656'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12657'>&quot;No, you are a good heart.  I want to go and--&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12658'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12659'>&quot;Be a reception committee?  I will go, too.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12660'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12661'>We crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside</div><div class='line' id='LC12662'>fences.  Even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight</div><div class='line' id='LC12663'>somewhat, but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and</div><div class='line' id='LC12664'>soon it was adjusted for present circumstances.  We had had to feel</div><div class='line' id='LC12665'>our way before, but we could make out to see the fence posts now.</div><div class='line' id='LC12666'>We started a whispered conversation, but suddenly Clarence broke</div><div class='line' id='LC12667'>off and said:</div><div class='line' id='LC12668'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12669'>&quot;What is that?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12670'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12671'>&quot;What is what?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12672'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12673'>&quot;That thing yonder.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12674'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12675'>&quot;What thing--where?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12676'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12677'>&quot;There beyond you a little piece--dark something--a dull shape</div><div class='line' id='LC12678'>of some kind--against the second fence.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12679'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12680'>I gazed and he gazed.  I said:</div><div class='line' id='LC12681'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12682'>&quot;Could it be a man, Clarence?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12683'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12684'>&quot;No, I think not.  If you notice, it looks a lit--why, it _is_</div><div class='line' id='LC12685'>a man!--leaning on the fence.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12686'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12687'>&quot;I certainly believe it is; let us go and see.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12688'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12689'>We crept along on our hands and knees until we were pretty close,</div><div class='line' id='LC12690'>and then looked up.  Yes, it was a man--a dim great figure in armor,</div><div class='line' id='LC12691'>standing erect, with both hands on the upper wire--and, of course,</div><div class='line' id='LC12692'>there was a smell of burning flesh.  Poor fellow, dead as a</div><div class='line' id='LC12693'>door-nail, and never knew what hurt him.  He stood there like a</div><div class='line' id='LC12694'>statue--no motion about him, except that his plumes swished about</div><div class='line' id='LC12695'>a little in the night wind.  We rose up and looked in through</div><div class='line' id='LC12696'>the bars of his visor, but couldn&#39;t make out whether we knew him</div><div class='line' id='LC12697'>or not--features too dim and shadowed.</div><div class='line' id='LC12698'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12699'>We heard muffled sounds approaching, and we sank down to the ground</div><div class='line' id='LC12700'>where we were.  We made out another knight vaguely; he was coming</div><div class='line' id='LC12701'>very stealthily, and feeling his way.  He was near enough now for</div><div class='line' id='LC12702'>us to see him put out a hand, find an upper wire, then bend and</div><div class='line' id='LC12703'>step under it and over the lower one.  Now he arrived at the</div><div class='line' id='LC12704'>first knight--and started slightly when he discovered him.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC12705'>stood a moment--no doubt wondering why the other one didn&#39;t move</div><div class='line' id='LC12706'>on; then he said, in a low voice, &quot;Why dreamest thou here, good</div><div class='line' id='LC12707'>Sir Mar--&quot; then he laid his hand on the corpse&#39;s shoulder--and just</div><div class='line' id='LC12708'>uttered a little soft moan and sunk down dead.  Killed by a dead</div><div class='line' id='LC12709'>man, you see--killed by a dead friend, in fact.  There was something</div><div class='line' id='LC12710'>awful about it.</div><div class='line' id='LC12711'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12712'>These early birds came scattering along after each other, about</div><div class='line' id='LC12713'>one every five minutes in our vicinity, during half an hour.</div><div class='line' id='LC12714'>They brought no armor of offense but their swords; as a rule,</div><div class='line' id='LC12715'>they carried the sword ready in the hand, and put it forward and</div><div class='line' id='LC12716'>found the wires with it.  We would now and then see a blue spark</div><div class='line' id='LC12717'>when the knight that caused it was so far away as to be invisible</div><div class='line' id='LC12718'>to us; but we knew what had happened, all the same; poor fellow,</div><div class='line' id='LC12719'>he had touched a charged wire with his sword and been electrocuted.</div><div class='line' id='LC12720'>We had brief intervals of grim stillness, interrupted with piteous</div><div class='line' id='LC12721'>regularity by the clash made by the falling of an iron-clad; and</div><div class='line' id='LC12722'>this sort of thing was going on, right along, and was very creepy</div><div class='line' id='LC12723'>there in the dark and lonesomeness.</div><div class='line' id='LC12724'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12725'>We concluded to make a tour between the inner fences.  We elected</div><div class='line' id='LC12726'>to walk upright, for convenience&#39;s sake; we argued that if discerned,</div><div class='line' id='LC12727'>we should be taken for friends rather than enemies, and in any case</div><div class='line' id='LC12728'>we should be out of reach of swords, and these gentry did not seem</div><div class='line' id='LC12729'>to have any spears along.  Well, it was a curious trip.  Everywhere</div><div class='line' id='LC12730'>dead men were lying outside the second fence--not plainly visible,</div><div class='line' id='LC12731'>but still visible; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic</div><div class='line' id='LC12732'>statues--dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire.</div><div class='line' id='LC12733'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12734'>One thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated: our current</div><div class='line' id='LC12735'>was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out.</div><div class='line' id='LC12736'>Pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound, and next moment</div><div class='line' id='LC12737'>we guessed what it was.  It was a surprise in force coming! I whispered</div><div class='line' id='LC12738'>Clarence to go and wake the army, and notify it to wait in silence</div><div class='line' id='LC12739'>in the cave for further orders.  He was soon back, and we stood</div><div class='line' id='LC12740'>by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful</div><div class='line' id='LC12741'>work upon that swarming host.  One could make out but little of</div><div class='line' id='LC12742'>detail; but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up</div><div class='line' id='LC12743'>beyond the second fence.  That swelling bulk was dead men!  Our</div><div class='line' id='LC12744'>camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead--a bulwark,</div><div class='line' id='LC12745'>a breastwork, of corpses, you may say.  One terrible thing about</div><div class='line' id='LC12746'>this thing was the absence of human voices; there were no cheers,</div><div class='line' id='LC12747'>no war cries; being intent upon a surprise, these men moved as</div><div class='line' id='LC12748'>noiselessly as they could; and always when the front rank was near</div><div class='line' id='LC12749'>enough to their goal to make it proper for them to begin to get</div><div class='line' id='LC12750'>a shout ready, of course they struck the fatal line and went down</div><div class='line' id='LC12751'>without testifying.</div><div class='line' id='LC12752'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12753'>I sent a current through the third fence now; and almost immediately</div><div class='line' id='LC12754'>through the fourth and fifth, so quickly were the gaps filled up.</div><div class='line' id='LC12755'>I believed the time was come now for my climax; I believed that</div><div class='line' id='LC12756'>that whole army was in our trap.  Anyway, it was high time to find</div><div class='line' id='LC12757'>out.  So I touched a button and set fifty electric suns aflame</div><div class='line' id='LC12758'>on the top of our precipice.</div><div class='line' id='LC12759'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12760'>Land, what a sight!  We were enclosed in three walls of dead men!</div><div class='line' id='LC12761'>All the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living,</div><div class='line' id='LC12762'>who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires.</div><div class='line' id='LC12763'>The sudden glare paralyzed this host, petrified them, you may say,</div><div class='line' id='LC12764'>with astonishment; there was just one instant for me to utilize</div><div class='line' id='LC12765'>their immobility in, and I didn&#39;t lose the chance.  You see, in</div><div class='line' id='LC12766'>another instant they would have recovered their faculties, then</div><div class='line' id='LC12767'>they&#39;d have burst into a cheer and made a rush, and my wires</div><div class='line' id='LC12768'>would have gone down before it; but that lost instant lost them</div><div class='line' id='LC12769'>their opportunity forever; while even that slight fragment of time</div><div class='line' id='LC12770'>was still unspent, I shot the current through all the fences and</div><div class='line' id='LC12771'>struck the whole host dead in their tracks!  _There_ was a groan</div><div class='line' id='LC12772'>you could _hear_!  It voiced the death-pang of eleven thousand men.</div><div class='line' id='LC12773'>It swelled out on the night with awful pathos.</div><div class='line' id='LC12774'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12775'>A glance showed that the rest of the enemy--perhaps ten thousand</div><div class='line' id='LC12776'>strong--were between us and the encircling ditch, and pressing</div><div class='line' id='LC12777'>forward to the assault.  Consequently we had them _all!_ and had</div><div class='line' id='LC12778'>them past help.  Time for the last act of the tragedy.  I fired</div><div class='line' id='LC12779'>the three appointed revolver shots--which meant:</div><div class='line' id='LC12780'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12781'>&quot;Turn on the water!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12782'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12783'>There was a sudden rush and roar, and in a minute the mountain</div><div class='line' id='LC12784'>brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a</div><div class='line' id='LC12785'>hundred feet wide and twenty-five deep.</div><div class='line' id='LC12786'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12787'>&quot;Stand to your guns, men!  Open fire!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12788'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12789'>The thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten</div><div class='line' id='LC12790'>thousand.  They halted, they stood their ground a moment against</div><div class='line' id='LC12791'>that withering deluge of fire, then they broke, faced about and</div><div class='line' id='LC12792'>swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale.  A full fourth</div><div class='line' id='LC12793'>part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment;</div><div class='line' id='LC12794'>the three-fourths reached it and plunged over--to death by drowning.</div><div class='line' id='LC12795'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12796'>Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed resistance</div><div class='line' id='LC12797'>was totally annihilated, the campaign was ended, we fifty-four were</div><div class='line' id='LC12798'>masters of England.  Twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us.</div><div class='line' id='LC12799'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12800'>But how treacherous is fortune!  In a little while--say an hour</div><div class='line' id='LC12801'>--happened a thing, by my own fault, which--but I have no heart</div><div class='line' id='LC12802'>to write that.  Let the record end here.</div><div class='line' id='LC12803'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12804'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12805'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12806'>CHAPTER XLIV</div><div class='line' id='LC12807'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12808'>A POSTSCRIPT BY CLARENCE</div><div class='line' id='LC12809'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12810'>I, Clarence, must write it for him.  He proposed that we two</div><div class='line' id='LC12811'>go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded.  I was</div><div class='line' id='LC12812'>strenuous against the project.  I said that if there were many,</div><div class='line' id='LC12813'>we could do but little for them; and it would not be wise for us to</div><div class='line' id='LC12814'>trust ourselves among them, anyway.  But he could seldom be turned</div><div class='line' id='LC12815'>from a purpose once formed; so we shut off the electric current</div><div class='line' id='LC12816'>from the fences, took an escort along, climbed over the enclosing</div><div class='line' id='LC12817'>ramparts of dead knights, and moved out upon the field.  The first</div><div class='line' id='LC12818'>wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back</div><div class='line' id='LC12819'>against a dead comrade.  When The Boss bent over him and spoke</div><div class='line' id='LC12820'>to him, the man recognized him and stabbed him.  That knight was</div><div class='line' id='LC12821'>Sir Meliagraunce, as I found out by tearing off his helmet.  He</div><div class='line' id='LC12822'>will not ask for help any more.</div><div class='line' id='LC12823'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12824'>We carried The Boss to the cave and gave his wound, which was</div><div class='line' id='LC12825'>not very serious, the best care we could.  In this service we had</div><div class='line' id='LC12826'>the help of Merlin, though we did not know it.  He was disguised</div><div class='line' id='LC12827'>as a woman, and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife.</div><div class='line' id='LC12828'>In this disguise, with brown-stained face and smooth shaven, he</div><div class='line' id='LC12829'>had appeared a few days after The Boss was hurt and offered to cook</div><div class='line' id='LC12830'>for us, saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps</div><div class='line' id='LC12831'>which the enemy were forming, and that she was starving.  The Boss</div><div class='line' id='LC12832'>had been getting along very well, and had amused himself with</div><div class='line' id='LC12833'>finishing up his record.</div><div class='line' id='LC12834'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12835'>We were glad to have this woman, for we were short handed.  We</div><div class='line' id='LC12836'>were in a trap, you see--a trap of our own making.  If we stayed</div><div class='line' id='LC12837'>where we were, our dead would kill us; if we moved out of our</div><div class='line' id='LC12838'>defenses, we should no longer be invincible.  We had conquered;</div><div class='line' id='LC12839'>in turn we were conquered.  The Boss recognized this; we all</div><div class='line' id='LC12840'>recognized it.  If we could go to one of those new camps and</div><div class='line' id='LC12841'>patch up some kind of terms with the enemy--yes, but The Boss</div><div class='line' id='LC12842'>could not go, and neither could I, for I was among the first that</div><div class='line' id='LC12843'>were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands.</div><div class='line' id='LC12844'>Others were taken down, and still others.  To-morrow--</div><div class='line' id='LC12845'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12846'>_To-morrow._  It is here.  And with it the end.  About midnight</div><div class='line' id='LC12847'>I awoke, and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about</div><div class='line' id='LC12848'>The Boss&#39;s head and face, and wondered what it meant.  Everybody</div><div class='line' id='LC12849'>but the dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep; there was no sound.</div><div class='line' id='LC12850'>The woman ceased from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing</div><div class='line' id='LC12851'>toward the door.  I called out:</div><div class='line' id='LC12852'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12853'>&quot;Stop!  What have you been doing?&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12854'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12855'>She halted, and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction:</div><div class='line' id='LC12856'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12857'>&quot;Ye were conquerors; ye are conquered!  These others are perishing</div><div class='line' id='LC12858'>--you also.  Ye shall all die in this place--every one--except _him_.</div><div class='line' id='LC12859'>He sleepeth now--and shall sleep thirteen centuries.  I am Merlin!&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC12860'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12861'>Then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled</div><div class='line' id='LC12862'>about like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against one</div><div class='line' id='LC12863'>of our wires.  His mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is still</div><div class='line' id='LC12864'>laughing.  I suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until</div><div class='line' id='LC12865'>the corpse turns to dust.</div><div class='line' id='LC12866'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12867'>The Boss has never stirred--sleeps like a stone.  If he does not</div><div class='line' id='LC12868'>wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, and</div><div class='line' id='LC12869'>his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses</div><div class='line' id='LC12870'>of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it.  As for</div><div class='line' id='LC12871'>the rest of us--well, it is agreed that if any one of us ever</div><div class='line' id='LC12872'>escapes alive from this place, he will write the fact here, and</div><div class='line' id='LC12873'>loyally hide this Manuscript with The Boss, our dear good chief,</div><div class='line' id='LC12874'>whose property it is, be he alive or dead.</div><div class='line' id='LC12875'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12876'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12877'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12878'>THE END OF THE MANUSCRIPT</div><div class='line' id='LC12879'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12880'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12881'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12882'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12883'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12884'>FINAL P.S.

The rain</div><div class='line' id='LC12887'>had almost ceased, the world was gray and sad, the exhausted storm</div><div class='line' id='LC12888'>was sighing and sobbing itself to rest.  I went to the stranger&#39;s</div><div class='line' id='LC12889'>room, and listened at his door, which was slightly ajar.  I could</div><div class='line' id='LC12890'>hear his voice, and so I knocked.  There was no answer, but I still</div><div class='line' id='LC12891'>heard the voice.  I peeped in.  The man lay on his back in bed,</div><div class='line' id='LC12892'>talking brokenly but with spirit, and punctuating with his arms,</div><div class='line' id='LC12893'>which he thrashed about, restlessly, as sick people do in delirium.</div><div class='line' id='LC12894'>I slipped in softly and bent over him.  His mutterings and</div><div class='line' id='LC12895'>ejaculations went on.  I spoke--merely a word, to call his attention.</div><div class='line' id='LC12896'>His glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with</div><div class='line' id='LC12897'>pleasure, gratitude, gladness, welcome:</div><div class='line' id='LC12898'><br/></div><div class='line' id='LC12899'>&quot;Oh, Sandy, you are come at last--how I have longed for you!

I seemed to be a creature</div><div class='line' id='LC12919'>out of a remote unborn age, centuries hence, and even _that_ was</div><div class='line' id='LC12920'>as real as the rest!  Yes, I seemed to have flown back out of that</div><div class='line' id='LC12921'>age into this of ours, and then forward to it again, and was set</div><div class='line' id='LC12922'>down, a stranger and forlorn in that strange England, with an</div><div class='line' id='LC12923'>abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you! between</div><div class='line' id='LC12924'>me and my home and my friends! between me and all that is dear</div><div class='line' id='LC12925'>to me, all that could make life worth the living!
